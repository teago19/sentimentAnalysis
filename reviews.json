all through the movie i kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. for the record, i'm 25 years old, and i've played warcraft and wow for many years since when i was 13 or 14 years old. ever since then, i haven't stopped playing. therefore you can count me as a fan. now onto the movie... gosh, i saw it at a pre-screening, and i kept wanting more of it. it just never gets boring! i really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for the fans. i also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence. those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. this movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the lore lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is duncan's vision of it. all of us have our own visions of the lore and books which may or may not be compatible with that of duncan's, but i can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as chris metzen; that's the thing with story: each player / reader has a different vision of it. as for me, i was blown away. never before have i felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if i had taken a walk in the town where i grew up, stormwind, goldshire, ironforge, everything felt so much like home, i was moved. i cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen. as for the changes, well, i found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but i enjoyed the story a lot. the actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, i had never seen orcs in such detail before, hulky, robust, terrifyingly but also relative. quite frankly, i can't wait for the next movie... in the meantime, i'll watch this one over and over again when i can. this movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. plus, it just might bring more people to actually play wow. parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost no blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsibility, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i actually thought this film would be bad. like most other video game movies i thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck. this movie broke the

and this movie exceeded my expectations. my biggest concern minutes before movie aired was the quality of the cgi.i knew this movie uses a lot of cgi.well the cgi is breathtaking easily equal or better to avatar and dawn of the apes, equally to jungle book(what a great movie!) but with the difference that it is used in massive scale, which makes it even more impressive. watching hundreads of orcs with unique characteristics and facials is mind boggling(with the positive way of meaning). orcs are beautifully beautifully made, main character durotan is just awesome he is my favourite character, humans are ok at start i had an issue with how armors looked but people told me it is exactly how in-game is.in terms of acting ben foster is hands down the best performer also paula patton and travis fimmel are nice, rest of the cast its slightly above average not great, but serviceable. orcs overall are better portrayed than humans, but thats the important thing if cgi was bad in this movie i would be really turned off, but the cgi is perfect so i can easily bypass the fact that 2-3 human chars weren't the best. i loved the plot, it is so rich and u can easily understand why some people said that this movie isn't even the 15% of the whole warcraft lore.duncan jones has done a great job for non-fans like me to easily udnerstand the movie, even though there are a few times that let u hanging which proposes hinds for a sequel. visuals are stunning and we can see probably the best implementation of magic that has been made in a movie. summing up this is a must watch for every person that loves fantasy genre, easily the best fantasy movie after the last lotr release(it would be at lotr level with 2-3 more decent actors). and easily the best video-game adaptation that has been made. 1-- breathtaking cgi 2-- it feels more like a movie(rather than a video game movie) 3-- incredible and rich lore/plot, warcraft universe is huge and after this movie i really want to

warned. i don't usually write movie reviews, if i like it i'll watch it again, if i hate it then i'll forget it. but i write it anyway because i think warcraft: the beginning is not terrible as most critics rated. unlike most fantasy movies, warcraft offers something different in plot: there is no good side or bad side, they are just people who need to survive, but evil always finds its way to corrupt them. i think it's a fresh idea to start with. the story is kinda fast- paced, but we can still follow it. it's not exactly the same as the lore, there are some crucial event are alternated in this movie, but still acceptable - unless for some lore-nerd who like to boast their knowledge by complaining every little difference. the ending is very promising for sequels. i'm pretty sure most players want to see how little go'el become a great warchief. i really love the cgi. as the director said, it's like a prop and they used it the right way. perhaps non-warcraft-gamers would feel weird to see the orc design (since the orcs in lotr version are like zombies), but this is how warcraft's orc look like. the score is great, it's so warcraft, and actually i want to hear more like it. the actor are doing their job the best they can, even though i personally have a little issue with garona (not her appearance or acting, but i expected her to be stronger and cunning, like how draka killed the orc who after her). since my heart lies with the horde, i had hard time to see durotan killed (toby kebbell is really a good actor, he was too underrated). but hey, this movie made me unable to hate the alliance because anyone who become the prison guard made me laugh! my suggestion for players, do watch this movie as duncan jonas' warcraft. and for non-players, do a little

source code) brings us his fanboy-driven adaptation of world of warcraft in what is easily one of the biggest movies of the year. when azeroth is on the brink of collapse from invading orc forces, two warriors from both sides must stand and fight for their families, their people and their worlds. duncan jones has said repeatedly he was a fan of wow and that this is a love letter to the game, and while i'm no fan of the games, i can definitely see it. this movie is what many fantasy fans have been waiting for after the tolkien adaptations, because we hardly ever get true high fantasy epics of such scale and scope. jones' direction was there, and was outstanding. the writing was good, but was where the movie also suffered; it needed to be twenty-thirty minutes longer to get through so much story that they jam-packed into two hours. i think the critical reception would have been better if the movie was longer, but, it wasn't, not to mention some cheesy dialogue, which i personally found refreshing. the cg was dazzling in every way, especially after a couple questionable trailers. the production values and combination of make-up, costumes and cg was incredible. even the musical score from ramin djawadi (known for his work on iron man and game of thrones) delivers a pulse-pounding fantasy soundtrack. the acting was what surprised me most with warcraft, with travis fimmel being brilliant in the human lead and toby kebbel as the emotionally gripping durotan, and the supporting cast (including the orcs) being very solid. jones made sure to have those quick tidbits of humor to help balance the dread and warfare, similar to what you'd see in lord of the rings or other films where quick, dry wit is used to offer breathing room among intensity (inception, interstellar, even jones' own movies moon and source code). overall, warcraft is what it should be, but not what it could have been. it's still one hell of an epic fantasy, but i can only put it on par with the hobbit, because it doesn't reach the same level of story-telling and character development lord of the rings achieves. hopefully, warcraft succeeds at the box office and legendary pictures green-lights the sequel, of which needs to be at least two and a half hours. but, please, see this when it comes out if you're into high fantasy or the video game. if you aren't, go on a $5 tuesday to give it a

cineworld on the opening day (30 may here in the uk). sadly the film does not deliver. with so many characters to keep track of and so little time for them all, i found that i didn't really care about the fates of any of them. it didn't help that two characters looked very similar and it was hard to tell them apart. then there was the acting. ye gods. i imagine this might pick up a few razzie nominations. one particular line was so woodenly delivered i thought i was watching the phantom menace. the plot was simple enough but because they were leapfrogging from character to character it didn't really have a chance to truly get interesting. for this film to do its characters justice it would need to have been six hours long. they should have stripped away maybe eight or nine of the 12 main characters and focused on them. plot is character. character is plot. this was drummed into me in university. if you want us to care about the characters then give us time to see them fail, win, live, love. with one a few to focus on you can then develop the plot. throw some emotion in there. they want to go the serious route? fine. make it serious then. but give us things to care about. show us some character depth. don't just throw a bunch of characters and names at us, expecting us to be so 'wowed' (no pun intended) that we forget that we're really just watching a mediocre advert for world of warcraft. because that's what it felt like. why am i being so critical of a film about orcs and humans? why can't i just give it a 10 because i loved playing the games? because i loved playing the games. see, when you really like something you want it to be as good as it can be when they do a film based on it later. also, despite a few mediocre jokes the film wanted to go the 'serious' route. so i have to treat it seriously. and not go into 'fanboy mode' and give it a 10/10. because this is not a 10/10 film. maybe it's all the marvel films' fault, going in with a huge amount of characters. somehow they pull it off, though. warcraft didn't. they say 'go big or go home' but in this case they should've started off with something smaller. there are enough fans for this to make a profit. i don't know if they should make a second one, though. because if this first one is so bad but makes money, i don't think they'll learn from this mistake. they don't care about

mega pumped to see the movie. it was an early morning, the first session in our cinema. as the opening title rose under the war drums, i began to maniacally cry... 12 fu*king years... i was ready for a bad flick, thanks to rotten early critics. the first 20 minutes were real fast paced. as a fan of wc3. i knew some of the early war stories, but not so in details. i never got lost throughout the narrative. it was almost solid, i'd say 89% solid. the rest is mist of self-understanding and \"figuring\". which is good, for once i can watch a movie again and see something that i missed or miss understood. let's talk visuals for a start. i'll be very honest. for the budget of 100 mills, it was overdone. which is good, means they put an enormous amount of extra effort into this. orcs were fluid and gave a very hard alien emotional drive throughout entire screen time. i felt a hunger for power from them, love for its own kind except for one individual, no fear, crazy mind-boggling strength. they had sympathetic feelings to viewers. i felt that orcs story was on par with the human, but it's strange to explain... basically, orcs hit your feelings in the first half and human side catches towards the climax of the picture. characters were all (except for poor khadgar) an a+, 10 out of 10, you name it. here is a thing to all those folks that got no clue about the lore... these humans are not from earth, they are from azeroth. so they might age slower. that's why i was keen to accept the casting choice for medivh and the king. i'll add that horse is not a normal cause, it's a different universe. deal with it, \"critic\". i think you'll know why khadgar didn't make the cut, once you'll see the film. now let's get to the juicy stuff. cons. for me, there were only three... three to five scenes had a motion blur effect on big structures, most of the scenes are still, but at those moments you felt the cracking budget on the cgi. no words, just khadgar! and here's my nifty spoiler and the main con, the reason why i cried the second time. when a certain main character dies in the midst of battle. and you know this amazing film is going to be over soon. you'll step out from the big dark room into the light of day. feelings shockering through your skin and bones, knowing that they went all in on this. for you, for the fan, for a casual moviegoer. this piece of art

the cinema to watch the movie. and the movie turned out to be exactly what i expected. the film looked and sounded wonderful (i'm already thinking oscar nominations for visual effects, sound editing, and sound mixing), but the story was weak and the characters vanilla. the cgi, which i had feared, turned out to be pretty gosh darned good (especially in relation to the orcs). the acting department of the film was not anything unexpected with a few decent performances and otherwise plain and wooden acting that seemed to gloss over the otherwise dramatic and interesting situations that some of these characters were thrown into. the largest issue with this film however is the weak story, the unbelievable screenplay, and the fact that the movie relies on the audience having previous knowledge of the warcraft lore (which i don't). travis fimmel, who i've only ever seen in vikings, plays the human protagonist, anduin lothar, and does so decently. now this is obviously not a groundbreaking or jaw dropping performance, but for a big action movie like warcraft his acting was fairly good. fimmel makes the character interesting, relatable, and easy-to-root-for, which is frankly more than anyone could have expected, so props to him. but fimmel was by no means excellent; on several occasions when he had to deal with loss there seemed to be a weird and inhuman lack of emotion. paula patton plays the half-human and half-orc female protagonist, garona halforcen, who flip-flops from horde to alliance and vice versa. this character, just like lothar, has a nice relatability and is easy for the viewer to get behind. patton's performance is also pretty decent, but just like fimmel, she had moments of uncomfortable stiffness and lack of emotion. i do think though, that in this case that could also be due to a screenplay that totally lacked any sense of believable dialogue. ben schnetzer also has a major role in this film as the mage, khadgar, who accompanies lothar for the majority of his journey. although the character is clich\u00e9 (i'll be saying that a lot), schnetzer's decent wit and mildly sarcastic approach makes the character fairly compelling and interesting. the character's major moments however are ruined by unpleasing directing and weird dialogue, but schnetzer did alright. ben foster also features in this film as the guardian of tirisfal, medivh. now i can honestly proclaim that i was lost for a large portion of his scenes which were something about mages and magic and 'fel', i think\u0085 but all that aside, foster did not help much himself. foster's portrayal was awkward and inconsistent, sometimes he'd loudly speak to himself and sometimes he'd have a large unjustified outburst of emotion with no true reason behind it, but for the sake of the story. dominic cooper portrays the young and dashing king llane wrynn, who rules azeroth. cooper's character is awfully clich\u00e9d, but is wonderfully grounded and believable and seems to mend some of foster's scenes. but ultimately the character fails to get the audience to back him and it seems truly outrageous that the same actor who made howard stark a likable character played such a dull character in such a big movie. toby kebell plays the noble yet awfully underused character of durotan, the leader of the frostwolf clan (a clan of orcs). in the very beginning of the film, the character is seen with his very young son, and this helps make the character appeal to the audience. although the character itself is interesting, and kebell's acting is decent, the character is so underused and pushed aside for story lines and plots that fall incredibly short of durotan's. robert kazinsky and clancy brown (mr. krabbs in spongebob) play orgrim doomhammer, the reluctant follower and occasionally good friend of durotan, and blackhand, the aggressive war chief of the horde, respectively. they both do decently in their roles and kazinsky especially has nice chemistry with kebell on screen. daniel wu is also thrown into the film as the classic evil manipulative magician-type character. though the character itself is clich\u00e9 and has no true backstory or anything (at least not in the film), wu does play the role well and if it were not for imdb, i would never have guessed that wu had played that character. ruth negga and anna galvin also feature in the film as lady taria, wrynn's wife, lothar's brother, and queen of azeroth, and draka, durotan's wife respectively. the two are really just shoehorned into the movie to make wrynn and durotan more relatable (i guess) and serve no purpose but to be wives, and although draka especially gets a few moments to shine, she is\u0096 despite significant screen time\u0096 absolutely forgettable. negga's acting in the film is depressingly and cringe-inducing wooden, while galvin's was a little more believable, but was still to a certain degree weak due to the lack of emotion she put into the character. and finally\u0096 because i'm tired of writing about these dull character\u0096 callum keith rennie plays moroes, medivh's assistant (maybe). the character is never really explained and although having a significant handful of scenes with medivh i have no clue why he was in the film or what his relationship was with medivh. but despite all that i can still point out the fact that rennie's acting (like countless other's) was uncomfortably wooden and he seemed to put no effort whatsoever into making the dialogue believable.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft after being a fan of the game, and

were messy and the editing was seriously not good. i mean, the scenes themselves were mostly well done, but they felt very unorganised, and different from each other. besides needing more character development, and background story, the movie needed a significantly more cohesive and streamlined expression. it felt like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and you could tell they have been working on it for a long time. in the latter part it really picked up and the movie seemed more deliberate with longer scenes, and very thrilling action. the griffin was badass! it really did stay true to the warcraft universe and i loved that. it was very beautiful and yes, heartfelt. the emotions of the characters shined through, even if they did not have a lot of time to build them up.

and our other beloved warlords had there moments too! there were some small lore-adjustments for the sake of better translating the game into the movie. but nothing game-changing or important! as a lore-expert (wow veteran, played the rts series, watched all nobble-videos and read most of the books) i was totally satisfied since duncan included all major events in the movie sticking to the original game-lore! i just sat there waiting for the next major plot-point and duncan delivered perfectly! the movie was loaded with game references and eastereggs from the mmorpg and the audience loved it. even the non-players were amazed...so don't hesitate bringing your friends that never tried warcraft before! the movie could have been slightly darker, but the fighting scenes were already borderline for the age-restriction that the movie got. the tone was similar to the avengers 2 movie (partially humorous partially serious). i rate this movie 9/10 as a warcraft fan. if i leave all the references aside that are made for fanservice it is still a very solid fantasy-movie, so i'm going with 7/10 for regular movie-watchers! -> think the movie will settle at 8/10 overall have fun

+ visuals, stunning. + acting was ok. i liked that it was serious in parts. everything must not be \"funny\" and disney all the time. i think it took itself less seriously than the hobbit though. + the action -especially when gul'dan was involved - was really epic and well choreographed. + if you like magic, you get plenty of mage action in here. + obviously some fan service here and there. i heard lots of people laughing and clapping hands throughout the movie. + the set- up for the sequel was nice. the bad: - pacing. the beginning is very fast. the first 20 minutes jump back and forth between locales. i'd rather have an slower pacing in the beginning, and then go all-in later. - some of the characters have very interesting back stories (especially khadgar and garona), but they're skimmed over. - we never really get to see much of the orcish world. - the movie feels a bit short. you could easily add 20 minutes without the audience feeling bored. so, all in all: are the critics right and the audiences wrong? well, i do think that some critics should question themselves. this movie can never get 1/5. that is blasphemy. a lot of love and care was put into this movie. my girlfriend, who knows nothing about warcraft, thought it was a good time. solid 3,5/5 from me. a movie worth watching in cinemas. you will most likely have a good time. it's no masterpiece, but it's

a final +2 to my approval. **for those paying attention, yes that adds up to 11 but imdb will only allow a max rating of 10.** in conclusion, i am relieved to say this turned out to be nothing i

characters. this is the only movie ever i wish was another hour long. i can understand that to some this movie is difficult to follow. but if you pay close attention, and remember faces you will never feel lost. the movie is executed very well in the time it uses, the action scenes were glorious. the movie found a good balance between battles and character interactions in order to best introduce the warcraft world to the viewer. i believe the movies needs more work in the future, but now after the first movie, it will be much easier tweaking the next to become the perfect game to movie

movie isn't some artistic breakthrough that will shatter the industry's foundations and set a precedent for all movies to come. it's not even the best of its kind. but that doesn't justify the abysmal reviews it has been getting, especially in view of meaningless flicks like captain america and its sort getting such high ratings. i'm a fan of warcraft lore in that i've followed it from very early on and appreciated some parts of it, though i freely acknowledge that it is a derivative mashup that usually falls short of anything substantial. subsequently i did not approach this movie with high expectations. in fact, i was pretty much certain that it would be a disaster, which made it all the more satisfying when i was proved to the contrary. the production values on some of the human set-pieces seemed fairly low. the writer who wrote the dialogue would do good to read game of thrones and educate himself a little. the actors that played the humans could have taken their characters further, though it was probably very hard with the given script. all in all, the movie felt very rushed with scenes cutting abruptly, leaving huge holes in terms of exposition. while game fans can easily fill in for themselves, others might find that more difficult, which probably explains some of the reviewers' chagrin. many plot devices used by the script were incredibly predictable and cheap as well. you might wonder why i've given the movie such a high rating despite all these many failings. yes, it has many, many flaws, but there is something to it, it has a heart of kinds that redeems it, that touches on something much deeper than you might expect it to, especially in the way it treats the plight of the orcish people, representing \"monsters\", which they supposedly are, as \"human\". the orcs are acted exceedingly well, their characters and dialogue are fleshed out, perhaps because the writers simply let themselves go of expectations since there could be none in this situation. situations in which their concept of honour is explored are incredibly touching and thought- provoking. their situation in many ways actually mirrors the situation of the syrian immigrants, who though they are of a different culture that in many ways clashes with ours, nonetheless find themselves without a home and in search of one, only to meet ours pushing them back. the reason i give the movie a high rating is that at its core, it is very strong. it falters in too many ways, but given an extra hour and some rewriting, it is so close to perfection that i feel it is a great shame

opinions, because they don't want to lose their reputation. they have a tendency to just jump on the hate-train for no particular reason. so don't listen to the critics, that is my number one tip for you guys! a couple of days ago, i watched a video on ign, with to guys who haven't even seen the movie, sitting their roasting it, that's actually scary to some extinct. a small pinpoint of what reviewing has succumbed to these days. on with the review though! i watched this with my dad, my sister and my friend. my dad and my sister have never delved into the warcraft universe (i highly recommend it though) but they enjoyed it quite a lot! i would compare this to the lord of the rings to an extinct. i watched it in a imax theater which was a great choice! it was a stunning thrill-ride. warcraft misses a little bit of buildup, which the lord of the rings had, the story gets a little bit fast paced. the warcraft universe is big, no doubt about that. so it was some hard choices that blizzard and legendary had to make. it was either, to please the fan community more, and add more references to other parts of the backstory that would make the movie confusing. or on the other hand, make it suitable for more audiences, so more people could it enjoy it. that is why a little bit of stuff seems a bit to shallow at times. its important to know that this movie is build upon one of the first warcraft games (orcs & humans), not world of warcraft, which many people think. that is why is mostly centered around orcs & humans, because not many of the events which include other races has occurred yet. but they will come, trust me! so good news for you if you are a die-hard elf fan! personally i had thought this movie was gonna be a huge flop. i had even prepared my own puns like \"borecraft\", \"snorecraft\" and \"a film i wish i had not payed forcraft\". but i simply couldn't find anything to hate about it, except the fast paced story. it looks fantastic! you need to see this for yourselves! the cgi worked very well with the humans, and you didn't at any point feel like they were just running around in front of a greenscreen. the dialogue was generic, and it didn't feel too forced like in the prequels of star wars for example, there was only a few flaws, nothing big. the choice of actors was great! simply loved toby kebbel(durotan) and travis fimmel(anduin lothar), they did a terrific job with portraying their characters! especially durotan seemed to steal everyone's attention when he was present during the movie! sometimes i think the armor that basically all the humans are wearing, can get a little bit too shiny and clean. like they are wearing a new one every 10 minutes. the orcs and their fierce armors of all kinds look fantastic! applause to the costume guy! its not only for fanboys, and i think duncan jones really wants to create something with this franchise, that i'm totally on board with! all hail the son of bowie. if they manage to pull of a sequel that is just close to as good as this one, i think warcraft could actually get to the point where it will be remembered as one of the big ones, like lotr and

with the things that were done well, though. the film looks perfect. the designs of the characters, the cg effects on the fantastic beasts, everything looks superb. i myself have only played world of warcraft for a few hours, and none of the original warcraft games. but i do play my fair share of hearthstone, the card game based on the world of warcraft. and i can say that a lot of the fun comes from recognising the characters. most of the designs are almost one to one with the original video game designs. also, the opening scene is gorgeous, but it sets expectations too high, sadly. the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the very first scene. now comes my biggest gripe with the film. with warcrafts extensive lore, the makers of warcraft:the beginning tried to stuff as many aspects of this lore into the film, which doesn't work out that well. the story feels extremely rushed and left me with a face struck with disbelief. the viewer does not have enough time to develop a bond with the characters, which damages the story, as there are many events that are supposed to have a huge emotional impact on the viewer. and then, during the last quarter, everything goes to sh*t. i will not go into detail since i do not like to spoil anything, but oh man, is it bad. overall, warcraft:the beginning is a pleasure for the eyes, and i'm sure that hardcore blizzard fans will enjoy it, but

and so is \"warcraft\". i saw the movie yesterday with a friend and honestly i didn't know what to expect of it. many critics were hating on the film but it was directed by duncan jones, so how bad could it really be? walking out of the theater i was very satisfied with the movie. jones brings the warcraft world to the big screen beautifully. i never got into the game and never even played it so i don't know a thing about the universe or the world itself. with \"warcraft\" you don't have to know/play the game to enjoy the movie because jones does such a good job bringing the universe to you and doesn't leave you hanging. throughout the film i couldn't help but feel this \"lord of the rings\" (2001; 2002; 2003) kind of vibe.the film feels that way because the structure and the universe of the film very well resembles that of \"the lord of the rings\". one thing i must say is that the motion capture and cgi for the film is spectacular. everything looks real and has beautiful detail. the movie plays the clich\u00e9d romance which felt very cheesy considering that the two characters didn't have that much in common and it was truly just poor writing. at times you can see where the cgi and actors differ very drastically, but considering how great the movie looks with all this cgi you can't help but let it slide. there were times where i laughed/giggled at serious or dramatic moments in the film. it felt cheesy and kind of cringe worthy. for a film to be called \"warcraft\" you should expect a lot of combat and boy do you get it. i was actually surprised how violent the film was since it had a pg-13 rating. you see limbs get blown up and cut off, and bones being broken, and i love it. you feel the force and power that the film has during its combat scenes. at times i even did an \"ooohhh!\" during a fight scene. the performances in the film are good to say the least, they're nothing spectacular but they fit for the film itself. the protagonist of the film is a cool character who i enjoyed seeing on the screen but i couldn't help but feel that his character was very underdeveloped. toby kebbell who voiced the main orc of the film was by far the most interesting and relate-able character of the entire film; and he's not even human! you cared much for the character and what was going to happen to him. the film has an issue with the human characters. whenever we transition back to the humans i couldn't help but feel the film slowed down drastically. the characters of the humans are very uninteresting and nothing new. plus, they were at times boring. but whenever we went back to the orcs the film picked up its pace because the characters of the orcs are much more well developed, and they were simply more interesting than the humans. i cared much more about the orcs than the humans. overall \"warcraft\" is a solid film by director duncan jones, but critics tend to disagree with a 27% rating on rotten tomatoes. honestly the critics got it wrong this time, i don't know why but they just did. if you're looking for a fun, harmless, summer movie \"warcraft\" is definitely the one to go see.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "first, i thought this

the outcome of the war. what makes this movie unique and separates it from other video game adaptations is; it doesn't bother with origin stories, instead, it hits the ground running, showing us who we are up against, the witch doctor, (if memory serves that is what he is called). who uses humans to fuel the gate, opens a door(the lack of a better term) to our world and this is where we our

alliance. those alongside some more nit-picky things takes a few points away for me. oh and also a particular scene resembling a biblical event triggered me to the nth degree. but enough about why it's not a 10/10 movie (i did give it an 8/10 after all), cause it was truly a fantastic surprise how good this movie actually was. first of all, the horde were fantastic, both visually and their

looks good (something that usually looks exceedingly awful in movies). the fights are brutal, the scope impressive. even the soundtrack is pretty good, tho it sometimes overdoes the boom boom effects.

having finally seen it, it did not disappoint. i will cover my non-spoiler thoughts first, then give a spoiler warning before covering my thoughts containing spoilers. the visuals and cgi is all wonderfully done. all pre-existing characters are portrayed keeping faithfully to the existing lore in terms of who they are and what they fight for. there are a few easter eggs for warcraft fans instantly noticeable, and i'm sure there are probably more i didn't notice. the film was a lot more gritty than i expected it to be, with quite a few depressing points. some of the cgi work is more grisly than i would have expected. there are a number of changes, which i will cover in the spoiler section of this review. while the part of me that hates change would prefer to keep things as they were, i honestly don't mind too much that they changed these details. the outcome is still more or less the same. i recognise that some things had to be changed to make the film work as a film, and i appreciate that. in terms of criticism, i feel that the film should have focused more on individual characters. other characters did appear, but weren't named. there wasn't really any time given at all to tell the audience who the individual characters were. this caused no problem for me, as i already know the characters, but i worry that someone who isn't already a warcraft fan might feel lost. of course as i am already a warcraft fan, i don't know. i certainly hope non-fans enjoyed it as much as fans did. there was also a sense that there was too much story packed into a single film, condensing it, losing details and opportunities to explain who characters were to the audience. in conclusion, i thoroughly enjoyed this film. i am eager for the official release, and i can't wait for further sequels! i would definitely recommend this film to anyone. ********spoiler warning************* ********spoiler warning************* at the same time as packing too much story into a short space of time, it also felt that not enough time was shown. the entire first war seemingly happens within the space of a couple of weeks. no time is indicated, but it seems that not much time occurred. in terms of characters, i have a couple of complaints. although starting off with a strong focus on durotan, nothing else is shown from his point of view after the film moves to the human point of view. blackhand is present throughout the film, but i just felt the film should have focused on him a bit more. several changes were made from established lore. now i will detail a few key examples. for a start, grommash hellscream is shown fighting against the humans on azeroth, despite the story establishing that he and the warsong clan remained behind on draenor, and did not encounter the humans until after the second war. in established lore, orgrim doomhammer was an orc of the blackrock clan. in the film, doomhammer is an orc of the frostwolf clan. however i approve of this change, as it gets durotan's and orgrim's friendship across much quicker and easier. in established lore, gul'dan immediately exiled the frostwolf clan on arrival on azeroth, and go to live in the region of alterac. in the film, the frostwolf clan are a part of the horde. draka and durotan are killed separately in different ways, at a different point in time. in the established story, durotan and draka were assassinated by shadow council spies after a meeting with orgrim doomhammer, after orgrim became warchief of the horde, during the second war. in the film, draka dies fighting a unnamed orc after sending baby thrall down a river in a basket to save him. durotan has the life drained out of him in mak'gora against gul'dan. in established canon, orgrim doomhammer killed blackhand to replace him as warchief of the horde. in the film, lothar kills blackhand in a mak'gora. the biggest change i approve of is the manner of garona's assassination of king llane. rather than being forced by the shadow council to kill king llane, king llane urges garona to kill him, to save herself after being surrounded by orcs, with blackhand making his way to personally kill king llane. with this ending, it makes a lot more sense as to why garona killed king llane. with this act, she is able to survive into a position of respect from the orcs, where she can help to create peace. the film ends on a bittersweet high point, with the formation of the alliance, rather than the expected ending of the sacking of stormwind. i expect this event will be covered in the second film.",

produced. actors: travis fimmel: does an amazing job and is very likable just as he is in vikings. toby kebbel (durotan) also does an amazing and convincing job. the only actor i didn't particularly like is paula patton, she doesn't fit the lore character and her acting is just not convincing making her the reason i gave 9 instead of 10. just to mention 1 scene, she gently drinks a cup of water during imprisonment after wiping her mouth. <-- not the typical behavior you would expect by a wild half orc. there are plenty of other scenes were she just doesn't act according to her character. its sad that a pretty face with little talent are allowed in such epic movies, i would rather have a talented ugly orc that could play her part instead of an emotional, good looking, unconvincing actor.

particular actually spends time with the orcs in exploring their cultural and political processes, so they feel like real beings and not just mindless monsters. this means that despite its rather straight laced high fantasy appearance, the more complex narrative gives the movie quite a modern feel. the action itself is great, the orcs in particular are awesome, and there's a bunch of cool easter eggs. the cgi can be a bit jarring at first, but i think that's because you're used to cg trying to be photo-realistic (and it is very good, very detailed), but once you realise it's trying to be more stylised, closer to the animation style of the game, you kind of \"get it\" and it's not really an issue anymore. i'm not a hardcore fan either. the last time i logged into the game was about 4 years ago, and even when i did actively play i wasn't in a clan, i didn't go on raids. my highest level character was about 70 from over several years. just a casual gamer. so i would advise any

movies are inherently bad\" forever. the problems come from one regrettable fact: movie was cut down way too much! it should've been at least 30min longer, or be the original 3 hours length, like lotr was; because you notice that there's some very abrupt cuts happening and there are missing scenes we've seen in the trailers or even sdcc leaks. that's why certain characters feel the certain lack of depth and/or character development and that's where the movie suffers greatly. so i'm a bit split on this matter; on one hand you see almost all the chieftain/warlords in the movie together (apart from ner'zhul for obvious reasons), yet they have no speaking lines, but on the other hand, it avoided the cluster-problem the hobbit had, where 13 dwarfs only had 4 dwarfs that really mattered, while

the movie is fun, entertaining and easily transported me to that azeroth universe. the last time i watched a movie 3 times in cinemas was the guardians of the galaxy, which is also a sprawling, high fantasy movie, albeit a space opera one. there's surely flaws with warcraft, but when the movie has that magical quality of making you instantly feel you are right in that universe, all those flaws fade away. all the characters in the movie are likable, and they are very nuanced, not one character is black or white. the humour are sprinkled here and there delicately. and the magic! they depict the magic in such grand, and majestic way. i think what almost everyone say about the pacing is probably correct, it seems 2 hours was not enough to tell the background stories of many of the important characters (i wanted more stories of khadgar, medivh and garona), and for a non-fan it can be confusing to tell apart one orc from another, although on my second viewing, they become all clear. 2 hours flew by (and that's a sign that a movie is very enjoyable) and i actually wanted more. i felt it should have been longer, which is very rare to say these days. one thing for sure: i will definitely watch the sequels and i am hoping legendary and blizzard give free reign to duncan jones in making the sequels the way new line cinema and warner bros gave free reign to peter jackson

know the quality blizzard put in their cinematics, so my expectations were actually high. boy, i was not disappointed! in one of the first scenes, gul'dan is opening the dark portal in an explosion of fel energy sucking souls of the draenei! the orcs, enhanced by cgi, look fearsome, brutal and believable! poor humans after years of peace have no idea what to do. the plot of warcraft 1 is understandably shaped to fit in a movie, and even though i consider myself a lore-fanatic, it was interesting to see what dunkan jones wanted to tell. there are two sides. the free races of azeroth are getting attacked but are too hesitant to form an alliance. whereas the horde, while mighty, is being torn apart by internal disagreements because gul'dan practices magic that corrupts land itself. fel energies have destroyed their homeland and are the reason they're seeking a new one in the first place, so that's why the \"good\" orcs oppose gul'dan. too bad the old warlock can wreck faces in melee combat. ouch! humans are depicted quite clueless, seeking the help of the guardian (of tirisfal), medivh. ben foster beautifully mastered his role of the mage possessed by a demon lord. the plot basically rotates around him. the whole story leading to khadgar getting to know medivh's secrets is retold in such a way, i didn't know what to expect next second. and the guardian's death is epic in itself, regaining control over himself and helping the humans in his final moments! garona is a strong, honest half-orc trying to survive in the war. unlike in lore, she doesn't seem to be magically enslaved by gul'dan here. but it has made her betrayal of humans even more tragic and heart-breaking! the visuals are completely out of the world. arcane magic is blue and powerful, fel is toxic and overwhelming, souls are sucked right from the shrinking bodies! i won't even touch on the architecture of stormwind, or kharazan, or oricsh tents and towers! the only critique i have is the screen time for the initial stage of the war when humans lost legions of their warriors is quite short (it would be nigh-impossible to include everything though). also, such places as ironforge and the flying city of dalaran (yes, in the first war) are only shown for brief moments. i hope, they'll return in the future films! overall, it's a solid base for the warcraft universe in the movie format.

but this one is not on of them. thank you blizzard that you give us this movie, i hope that we will have 2nd and 3rd part, because warcraft universe is huge and has so much potential to became one successful franchise. and for the end, this is not world of warcraft, this is warcraft movie base on the game release in 1994, orcs vs humans.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "this movie was better

i haven't played. one thing that caught my eyes , was the way it looked like avatar with awesome screenplay and cgi . warcraft has everything that made avatar famous and if you ask me its even better .", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft is a movie that has an 'ok' story and fairly good visual effects, but is incredibly fun to watch for fans of the fantasy genre. the first problem with the movie is some of the casting choices, although the orcs were perfect and travis did a fantastic job as lothar, some other characters like dominic cooper as the king and ben foster as medivh feel misplaced. in my opinion, all video game movies should only be made up of good actors who enjoy the actual video game, so they'll put more soul into their performance. -the other problem is some of the special effects. don't get me wrong, most of it was absolutely mind blowing and we have never seen a film on the big screen with so much magic and spells, not even lotr. however there were some moments that the cgi looked a bit naff, such as the clay golem and the wall of lightning, but that might just be me. i also felt like gul'dan at points looked very video-gamey with his cgi. -the combat was a mixed bag. the large action scenes were epic and i absolutely loved the final battle, but there were points in some of the smaller scenes where humans were fighting orcs and it looked a bit clumsy and awkward, and even slightly cartoonish. -the story was easy to understand, but i feel it wasn't developed well, though it's understandable because of time constraints, but lothar's son was hard to sympathize with, and the romance between garona and lothar felt forced as hell. - there were also some pointless scenes in there, such as the visit to goldshire and dalaran, those just feel like they were in there simply to show off the lion's pride inn, and dalaran. also i don't know why alodi was a woman but whatever. there was also draka giving birth which was a bit weird, in my opinion. however, there's much good in the movie which leads me to think this is the best video game movie to date. the first point is some of the performances were incredible, specifically the orcs durotan and ogrim, as well as garona and lothar. all were played extremely well. -the story follows warcraft 1 not world of warcraft, for all those people out there that say things like \"the warcraft movie isn't good because you can't make a good story out of world of warcraft as it's a world not a story.\" no, it follows the game from 1996, not 2004, and that game has an extremely easy to follow story, and they portrayed it damned well on the big screen. though the friends i saw it with had trouble understanding where the orcs came from, they knew what was happening and they know nothing about the warcraft universe. was the story original and unique amongst fantasy? well amongst mainstream fantasy on t.v or the big screen it is, but sure, almost every fantasy story line has been done a thousand times. people compare this story to lotr, which is actually dumb because the only similarities it shares with those films is humans and orcs, and even the orcs are vastly different. the warcraft movie story is how the orcs and humans meet, and it's easy to understand. - the soundtrack to the film was incredible, from the moment it opened i was blown away by that score done by ramin djawadi, the guy who has done many of the game of thrones scores as well. - the visuals were also incredible. as mentioned earlier there were problems with some of the cgi at times, but overall it was fantastic, on the levels of something like avatar which had a far bigger budget than this. the world looked immense, the orcs looked incredible and the armour on the humans was the perfect blend between ott warcraft armour, and realistic plate armour. the set designers also did an incredible job with the stormwind streets and throne room, although we didn't see enough of the former. - there were only two real 'villains' in the movie: gul'dan and medivh. both were very good. medivh is discovered by khadgar and lothar to be corrupted by the fel, but he does a good job hiding it up until that point, and at first you do believe he is a good guy, which just adds to how well he was played. gul'dan is more of a stereotypical villain, but he certainly brought some incredibly dark scenes into the movie which was actually refreshing to see in a big- screen fantasy, and his fight with durotan was epic. in all, both are great antagonists. - the ending was alright, although it was an obvious cliffhanger which kind of took away from it (i was expecting the fall of stormwind), but the 'for the alliance' moment gave me chills as an alliance player. but the final battle itself was great, and although it was a lot different to the warcraft 1 story, it worked well and they did a good job with it. in all, it isn't lotr or got, it is its own stand-out story. it's also based off warcraft 1, which had a clear and easy-to-follow story. i haven't played warcraft 1 or 2 and i only have basic knowledge of the lore around those games, but i still found it easy to understand and thoroughly enjoyable. objectively it'd be a 6 or 7/10, but because i had such fun watching it and it is arguably the best video game movie to date, i'd say my experience was an 8/10 watching this in the cinema, and i enjoyed it as much as some much bigger films that are objectively better.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "a great movie for anyone open to the fantasy genre. expect to see the best visual effects of all-time on any medium. full cgi, and yet a streamlined and awesome experience throughout. furthermore, the music score is incredible. make sure to see it in cinemas with proper audio setups (had a specific dolby cinema room at my viewing). the action and fighting scenes are horrifyingly awesome, add-in that no character is 'safe' (which is typically a flaw for 'hero-type' movies). warcraft the beginning transcends most fantasy films in almost every way. while the whole movie was great, it gets overshadowed by a bad last twenty minutes. this part seemed incoherent, poorly edited and had an awkward 'surround'/talkative scene. other rightly bad remarks: there is only one obvious bad guy. the theme and 'message of the film' is all over the place: \"light from darkness, darkness from light\"? \"zero hope gives great courage\"? add in some dragged scenes where the point was already made, whereas some scenes ended too quickly. perhaps it was difficult to change scenes as it is cg heavy, and too costly and time-intensive. finally, this gets enlightened by bad dialogue with typical fantasy lines & clich\u00e9s - get creative you lazy hollywood fantasy screenwriters! despite all the above, this is fantastic, awesome, fast-paced, epic cinematic experience. definitely for fans, and for anyone open to fantasy. 9/10 in response to the critics: if it was released during the 'christmas period' perhaps they would be more open to fantasy films. clearly this is better than 'the hobbit' or 'avatar', but of course not 'lord of the rings'. so, knowing it is

duncan jones makes a new approach into the fantasy universe and doesn't have fear to use color and action. all the action scenes make sense and fit well into the universe, working with the story. the story is just like the game, and if someone go to the movie expecting something different than warcraft, obviously will be displeased. it is a movie about war, magic and orcs! it meets all that was stated from the beginning. when you go to see warcraft, you can't expect a new lord of the rings or game of thrones. neither a new marvel movie or dc. warcraft is another kind of history, and duncan jones insists in this. he brings another aesthetic and another kind of history pace. and let's face it, today we are living a boom of superheroes (and \"geek\") movies, just like there was a western boom years ago, for example. movies that try to go against the river are ignored or vilified. and most movies are classified into two types: intelligent movies or blockbusters. the ones which will try an oscar and the ones which make a good money. warcraft, being born from a game, is the focus of much prejudice. \"who dares to try to make a movie about a video game?!\" for most critics video games are childish, but for our luck, game designers think different and are ahead, making games like heavy rain and the last of us. the game industry already uses cinematography strategies to achieve an unique experience. and it is stupidity that the movie industry keeps ignoring this new universe of media, and lives inside of a bubble of constructed rules. but hey! let's think outside the bubble!",

to follow so i hope people aren't put off as i almost was. the feature certainly didn't disappoint in terms of battles either. i only found out it was a 12 just before it started and from then expected a bounty of boring play-fights, but you honestly would never guess. seriously, some seriously brutal action in there. the visuals are absurdly good. it all felt so real and does such a terrific job of sucking you into the world. they painted such a beautiful and terrifying world that looked truly wondrous on the big screen. i'd say the downsides are that it does throw a lot of stuff at you which can be off putting. and it does slow down a little at the beginning, lumbering you down with introductions that seem to drag on. that said, i think that it was a necessary evil as the film definitely picks up afterwards, using all these characters to indulge you in an absorbing and in-depth story. the story itself wasn't all that revolutionary in my opinion, but i still thought it was solid. overall, it felt like a gripping amalgamation of lord of the rings and avatar. would certainly recommend to both fans and non-fans alike.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i will start saying this is not your typical review. whenever i read reviews, i look for semi-objective pros and cons to the film and not eloquently written opinions, so if you are like me, read on! otherwise, i recommend you turn back. the way i write is also pretty boring, so there's that. i saw this movie with my girlfriend in germany (in english, though) last night. i should probably state that i have long been a fan of the warcraft games, and as such familiar with the general story-line, but i'm not enough of a fan to have read any of the books or comics. my girlfriend, on the other hand, knew absolutely nothing about the story, apart from a rough idea which races exist in the warcraft universe because she had seen me play. with that being said, both of us absolutely loved the movie! it was one of those movies i didn't want to end, and it was exiting throughout. after it was over, i was left craving for more and i simply can't get the story out of my head now. it's been a long time since i've felt so invested in a movie. the feeling this film left me with is almost more impressive than the movie itself. to give you a more helpful review than just some empty statements though, let me list the pros and cons of the movie from both my and my girlfriend's point of view, so maybe you can make up your own mind whether warcraft is for you or not: pros: - the cgi was fantastic. 10 minutes into the movie we felt fully immersed and forgot how much of the movie was cgi. - most of the characters seemed genuine, had clear motives and did not feel cookie-cutter at all. - the music felt pretty epic. - we obviously really liked the story. - the fact that it did not shy away from being \"dark\" and at some points depressing made it feel more believable. my girlfriend was close to crying at least two times. - there was some humor, but the movie still felt serious (not as silly as a marvel movie, more like dc) - while there was some romance that my girlfriend felt added something the movie, it definitely did not feel forced (looking at you hobbit) and was very much a side-note. more sexual tension than romance really. cons: - the first half of the movie was quite fast-paced. it jumped from one scene to another rather abruptly. surprisingly, this seemed to bug me more than my girlfriend. the second half made up for it though. - some characters could have used some more introduction or characters development. the movie could easily have been an hour longer. still, the main characters felt fleshed-out. - my girlfriend noted that she felt very unsatisfied with how the story ended. so for people who want to see a story with a happy ending or if you hate cliffhangers, this is not for you. - this again seemed to bug me more, but since so much of the movie was cgi, it felt, for lack of a better word, \"damp\" at times (i got a similar feeling watching avatar and 300, for reference). - i felt the armor the humans wear is a bit ridiculous. yeah, it's like that in the games, but it could've been toned down a little. neutral: - 3d seemed good, i'm not a 3d fan in general though. - some nice bonuses for warcraft fans if you pay attention, but since this does not affect newcomers i won't add this to pros. - the original story was changed a little, but not in ways that would offend fans. - being a warcraft fan, i know how much more the story has to offer. i really want this movie to succeed so one day they will make a sequel or spin-offs. so is this movie worth your time? yes, if the following is true for you: - you don't go in expecting it to be bad. lots of \"professional\" reviewers from the us are giving this movie lots of hate i honestly feel is not justified. i could understand a 6/10 for the cons stated above, but some of them are ripping this movie apart so much that it feels like they were going to do it no matter how the movie was. i'm usually a pretty harsh critic myself, but this i just don't understand. - you don't expect a happy movie and ending. - you don't give up on the movie after the first few minutes. - you actually enjoy a darker movie with a few lighthearted moments. - you don't mind the film having a lot of cgi. - you generally enjoy fantasy movies. summed up, i would place this movie far above the hobbit, and probably slightly below lord of the rings. while lotr had better character development and pacing, i highly prefer warcraft's general story and feel. overall, a 9 from me and an 8 from my girlfriend.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft was great, story felt a little rushed at times

because it's based on a video game. duncan jones has mastered the source material and succinctly transferred it to the silver screen. in order to cover all the back story and lore contained in the warcraft universe would take over 4 hours of screen time, however, jones picks the most crucial elements of the plot from 1994's 'warcraft: orcs and humans'. the most striking thing about the film is the meticulous attention to detail that jones shows. it enables him to provide very sly moments of fan-service without detracting too much from the narrative. if you've played world of warcraft, you'll be sure to catch a glimpse of something you recognise from your in-game adventures; but equally, jones makes sure the story isn't too contrived so as to keep the general public engaged in the story. aside from the lore detail, the cgi is simply breathtaking. this is the first noteworthy film where the magic looks and feels believable. not only that but the specifics of the cgi orcs made them even more eye-catching than the faithful recreations of azeroth's fabled landscape. the one criticism of the film i can muster is that the dialogue at times seemed a bit forced. understandable for a project of this size and scale, it seems the interactions between characters focused more on reminding you of everyone's name at times rather than focusing the plot. it doesn't detract too much from the film, however it is noticeable. overall, the critics will say the film is a dud simply because of the origin of the source material. but as the early indicators from the international box office have shown, there is a demand for more from jones' azeroth. and with both the u.s. and china being massively underestimated - the film could yet prove the naysayers wrong. it certainly is on it's way to doing so. a diamond in the rough, but it could yet turn out to be a 'millennium star'.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "just saw this today (31/05/2016) after only finding out about it a

wish i had listened to him but no, i listened to cartman instead. loved playing the game especially the stories in the game without speeding along to complete quests after quests etc. so its been a while since i played (i'm 50 years old now, its tough finding time). it was a pleasure to sit back and visit places of azeroth i'd not seen in over 3 years, i have been forgetful about character names

spots? yes, absolutely. i admit, people who've played the games (both wow and the strategy series) will enjoy this movie far more than a person that had no experience with the franchise. let's start with a couple of scenes i think fell short. garona's assassination of llane had a weird vibe to it. why not do it like it was done in the lore? it would have made the experience far richer and i think garona still wouldn't have been an antagonist, but her character would have definitely become more appealing. i think that was a missed opportunity. the romantic stuff was... well, to me it was a little cringe-worthy, but not too bad. nothing tops the overly awkward chemistry between natalie portman and hayden hayden christensen in attack of the clones, so perhaps that has given me a higher tolerance of cringe-worthy romance. it did not fill too much time, so i don't hold that against the movie. the dialogue however could have been written far better than what we were given. why not destroy stormwind city like it happened in the games? that would have been fantastic and actually been a far more dramatic finish! people who did not know the franchise before would have been surprised at the outcome of the movie. the ending just felt a little too hollywood i'm afraid. the pacing: jesus christ, everything happened so fast! i really think some people who haven't played the games were/will have trouble to grasp what's actually happening. it feels like there is no quiet moment, no second to breath and while some may like that (hell, i understand the appeal) i belong to the people who prefer it when there are a couple of scenes that let settle things for a moment. however, i admit that that is just my personal preference. more positively, because i feel like i bashed the movie, while not trying to do that: the little winks now and then to fans of the franchise. i couldn't help myself to smile and thought they were entertaining and thankfully not overdone. the cast seemed perfect, although i imagined lothar to be slightly older than in the movie (but i love the actor, so f**k it). for the most part i think they stayed as true to the lore as they could, and i believe that the ending was done the way it was, due to intervention by the studio. the action sequences were enjoyable and the movie gave me everything i expected of it. no more, no less... and

comes to the lore of warcraft. i have read at least 6 of the books, played all the strategy games and quite a bit of the world of warcraft content. contrary to what i've mostly been hearing, this is not a world of warcraft movie. the story line of warcraft progresses linearly, warcraft\uf0e8warcraft 2\uf0e8warcraft 3\uf0e8 the frozen throne\uf0e8world of warcraft\uf0e8expansions. this movie only includes story line content from the first warcraft, indeed none of the characters should be recognizable to a wow fan (except the baby, if you know who that is). warcraft has always been a very character centered story, indeed nothing happens without a character leading the action, there is no such thing as x race doing y. instead it is character z leading a portion of race x to do y. as such the movie should be judged on how well it developed its characters. on the positive side i thought the orcs were very well developed, not only do we empathize with durotan but we also get a sense of the cultural attitudes that the orcs have, with many chieftains and constant fighting between the clans. as such the orcs are successfully portrayed as an honor culture instead of just purely barbaric, to me this is a great success and something that has never been done on screen before. warcraft to me has established a universe that has much more potential than the lord of the rings if only because of the empathy one feels for both sides. on the negative side i thought the humans were a little rushed. khadgar, the young apprentice mage had rather unnatural dialogue and the actor playing him felt a bit off at times. lothar was also slightly underdeveloped, perhaps a little more on his relationships should have been done, especially with his son. visual effects wise i thought the movie was amazing, the spells are truly epic and there is a real sense of scale to be felt. this is not the fantastic movie i was hoping for but it has no large overarching faults, and within the time limit it probably achieves as much as it could have, it is only a shame that it wasn't longer so that it can properly hit all on the tonal cords. however with the universe established, there is

you will enjoy it anyway. great effects, great cgi especially the orcs! they surely look awesome. don't listen to the \"critics\" go and watch it! it's not even close to being \"very bad\". i'am definitely looking forward to a sequel, or maybe a trilogy.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "incredible movie! an absolute must watch for fans og the warcraft universe, if you have ever played

it consisted of only fan boys who were promoting the movie just because of nostalgia and fandom. i was aware that some of the critics had given quite bad reviews and therefor i went to see the video with quite low expectations... i was positively surprised. personally i've played all the warcraft games and followed the series since the 90's. i know the general story line, but i would not consider myself as a \"big fan\". i'm just a normal gamer. this movie seem to be the first movie in a series of future warcraft movies. therefor it is trying to introduce the universe for the viewer, while at the same time presenting an interesting story. this makes the movie a bit confusing and it definitely feels like they tried to push a bit too much into too short amount of time. the movie has a love story which definitely feels rushed and comes out of nowhere. the movie jumps between locations and scenes very quickly multiple times which leaves the viewer a bit confused what just happened, and while it does this it also tries to stick with the main story line of the orc invasion of azeroth, while also trying to introduce this giant universe to the viewer, and explain a clash of different magic types between warlock and mages. even me who has played all the games got confused and i wondered how other people in the theater must have felt. the cgi is top notch and it's not a single time where i feel that the cgi, magic spells or other effects disturbed in any way. it felt very natural and the orc's definitely felt natural together with the human actors. the cgi in warcraft is way better than other fantasy movies such as the hobbit trilogy. even though the movie has some problems with its story line, where it tries to push a bit too much information in a very short amount of time, i still consider this movie a success and i consider it one of the better fantasy movie that i've seen in a long time. the main story line was good. the bad guy was amazing, the art and cgi looked great and i look forward to see the coming movies in the warcraft franchise. my wife who joined me for the movie, without knowing anything about the warcraft universe enjoyed the movie even more than i did. she was confused about some parts but it did not prevent her from enjoying the movie.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "my first review: apologies for formatting. first of all: i'm a devout warcraft fan. now the important part: should you see this film? if you are a fan of warcraft (be it the first games or wow), this movie is absolutely worth the watch. if you are a casual viewer with an interest in seeing something new, you might want to read a bit about the franchise beforehand. if you have no experience with the games and no intentions of immersing yourself in the universe that is warcraft, i strongly suggest you do not watch the film, unless you will be able to walk out of there afterwards and admit that you are in no position of fairly judging it. now comes the actual review: the early, split plot that allows us to follow the orcs and humans separately makes perfect sense to the knowledgeable viewer. the scenes are quickly set, and all of the characters that we should engage ourselves in quickly introduced. the humor is very much in line with the games and with no prior experience, you might miss it and wonder why all the other people laugh so wholeheartedly. the cgi (especially the orcs and magical sequences) is stunning and lives up to blizzard's good name. the cast gives solid performances, especially ben foster and travis fimmel, who knows how to carry as the main character. the romance between garona and lothar being so \"sweet\" (my best description) is the only thing that feels slightly out of place. all in all, 9/10 and a definite must watch for anyone with an interest in a story that will hopefully get many sequels, or for anyone who just wishes to feel that universe and its quirks in a new way.", "class":

the movie a serious one, and a faithful adaptation to the original lore in every way, and without any fancy side stories. through the movie, i remembered my adventures in the game, in every location and character, this movie is a must see for everyone.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "let me start off by saying that i am long time fan of warcraft, i used to play warcraft i back in first grade, and i still play wow to this day, i read almost every book, i know almost every single story element, so it's safe to say i was very invested in the film's success so when the final product finally came i was a bit disappointed, and i also wasn't, the film could be a lot better and i mean a lot, but it also tried to do the best it could honestly. warcraft's story is so dense, with so many characters that it's hard to showcase everything in it in just 2 hours, so the movie feels like a very long game of thrones episode, which is good, but it also feels like we've started off in the middle of season 3 which isn't. if you're not familiar with the universe you might get lost. the film frantically tries to introduce the myriad of characters with mixed success, sometimes we get a very organic dialogue between durotan and draka(our orc protagonists) where we get their motivations and their characters, and then sometimes we get awkwardly shoehorned in backstories from khadgar, garona and lothar( our human side protagonists) where it feels like history homework instead of actual character building. we keep jumping from place to place so fast that we don't even have time to read the town signs, because it's a huge world and apparently all corners of it have to be introduced right away, it's so obsessed with building a world that sometimes it forgets to make a movie. characters don't always get enough breathing room due to how many of them there are and many of them suffer from it, like ben foster's medivh who's painfully underused for such a major role in the story, or lothar's son who's basically there only to get emotional scenes from travis fimmel. the performances are decent, but none of them are really outstanding, ironically though the orcs managed to get more emotion out of me than the humans despite being entirely cgi, they seemed to fit much more into this world than the humans, and the director and screenwriter seemed to be more interested in them as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, we're more familiar with humans than with orcs, because these orcs aren't like any we've seen before, they aren't the mindless evil bad guys of lotr, they're honorable and proud beings who are looking for a new home. the film does a perfect job depicting the motivations of both sides, and even the different motivations inside the sides, it's not a good vs evil film, it's much more intricate and deep than that, referring back to my game of thrones point, it's much more similar to that, no side is wrong and no side is right and the film balances it very well and manages to make us feel bad for losses on both sides, which is something i've never seen a fantasy film do before. i find it hard to believe though, knowing duncan jones, that there isn't an extended version of this where the major flaw of the film (not enough time spent developing the characters) is not \"fixed\" it feels like a classic case of over editing to meet a certain length cutoff, and so the movie cant really breathe. but despite all it's flaws it's fun, beautiful(probably the best use of cgi i've ever seen), uses a great mix of comedy and drama, knows when to be serious and when to be light hearted, just like the games. if you're a fan of warcraft you'll probably love it, there's tons of little details and nods to fans in the movie that will just make you squeal with joy when you see them, and if you're not a fan of warcraft you still get a decent fantasy flick, but admittedly you might get lost in the ocean of names and places the movie throws at you. i think it's worth the price of the ticket for sure, even if it is not the saviour of video game movies i hoped it would be, it's a good start.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "played

3d and i truly enjoyed it. actually, i'm planning to see it again while i can still see it on imax. i am familiar with the warcraft games including warcraft 3 and world of warcraft, so i knew most of the characters, the world and the core of the story, the reason i went to the cinema to see it is to get immersed in the world that i like adventuring and witness the events that i have been playing/reading about for years now. i will not say warcraft is a perfect movie or it is the best it could have been (which is why it gets an 8 from me), however it is a movie that is immersive, fast-moving, full of action; that has a soul, beautiful soundtrack, beautiful scenery and many things that will make you smile if you are a warcraft/wow player. i have watched dozens if not hundreds of movies in the cinema and i can honestly say that warcraft is the only movie that made me forget the time. like how playing wow usually does, hehe. i was in a large/crowded room (imax) and i was worried that popcorn eaters and smartphone checkers would annoy me. except for one instance which did not repeat, i was hooked by the movie from start to end and watched it without remembering any distraction from my surroundings. i believe most viewers watched it fully focused like me. when the first half ended, i didn't believe that 1 hour had already passed. the second half passed quicker because when it ended, i was thinking to myself \"this never happened to me before with any other movie\" even though some of which i enjoyed more such as lord of the rings, avatar or interstellar. after the movie ended, i stayed till the credits finished rolling because it was the first time i was listening to wow theme in an imax theater, which took about 5 minutes. about 1/5th of the room (30- 40) also stayed till the credits ended and i was hearing mostly nice feedback from the audience. to me, warcraft movie, also as its name implies, is the beginning of a long story and it felt more like a short and fully packed prelude that tries to show a lot of things within a short time. it succeeds in a sense but at some scenes i felt the transitions were very quick and some other scenes could have used more build-up. some characters could have had more screen time and also a bit more emotional backgrounds would have amplified the tone of the story. i would think that if it was about 150-160 minutes, it might have been better. that's my opinion for sure. either way, i think it was a great intro and i am definitely looking forward to seeing many more in the series. after lotr and hobbit, hopefully this will be my third favorite fantasy movie series. if you are not familiar with warcraft universe, or never played any warcraft games, warcraft movie is a beautiful and enjoyable fantasy movie that i can highly recommend. if you are a warcraft, or especially a wow player, warcraft movie is a movie you shouldn't miss. i'm not sure if the 3d aspect added much to the movie but if you have the option, definitely see it on imax. for the alliance!", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i did wonder if anyone other than a player could appreciate this film or fathom out what on earth

before starting this review: i have never ever had remotely anything to do with the warcraft lore and games, i had literally no idea what the story would be. yet, i am a very, very big fan of fantasy and duncan jones, and that is why i was excited to see this film, despite the negative backlash it had in its first week of reviews and let me tell you that i've rarely seen such unmotivated negativity. despite not living up to its potential jones and legendary pictures have put out a very worthy fantasy film that actually was very close to being great...up until its last ten minutes. giving any kind of vote to this film based on its first watch is really hard and i reserve my right to change it in the future, that is because i am still conflicted in how much i liked it, which is indicative of the chaos it induces with that ending. for a solid hour and forty five minutes duncan jones crafts a really strong fantasy picture. the only problems it bears for that duration are minor world building problems, they don't stop the story from flowing but sporadically the film is a little too ahead of itself and gives the viewer some confusion on how the world is organized, the opening scene should have been cut full-stop, it makes no sense at all, and it also happens to be slightly mechanical, in the sense that the flow of the scenes happens to be a little repetitive after sometime: emotional scene, character development scene, action scene, repeat. it isn't really that bothering, but it was something that did occasionally take me out of the film. yet for the rest we are presented to an interesting world with characters we feel for on both sides. the pace is very tight and i was never bored for half a second, everything that was going on i wanted to see more of. there are some moments that really sting emotionally and some others that are story turns you don't expect and with which the filmmakers have the balls to stick to which makes them even more resonant. the actors involved i did not have much faith in, but they all managed to surprise me, in particular travis fimmel who is channeling his inner aragorn and excelling at it. the social dynamics explored might be a little underdeveloped, but the when you are presented with such a rich vision to sink your teeth into it doesn't really matter, the world-building overall was enchanting, i was transported to this world and that is something that is really rare in filmaking. moreover, the effects here are game changing. the 20 months spent in post production pay off from the first frame. starting off the success of the effects is the fact that the cgi is used correctly as a tool and not a gimmick and integrated seamlessly in what is one of the best looking and designed movies in recent years. then on top of that you add state-of-the-art looking imagery, you are left with a film that dazzles visually without ever taking you out of it. no matter how the film will be received critically, there is no question these effects will change the game for films, but more importantly they are an example of how to use computer imagery correctly. a killer score and breath-taking, goose-bump-inducing action sequences with storytelling momentum add to the list of great stuff i was enjoying from this film. until the last ten minutes came and i realized i wasn't going to get a pay off. look i am fine if you want to do a trilogy of films, \"fellowship of the ring\" is the best film ever made (alongside its two successors) and it doesn't have an ending to the plot, but it has an ending to the story, you get emotional pay off from the characters, you get closure for the time being. here you are promised for the first two and a half acts of tight pacing a kind of resolution but it never comes, this film is lacking a finale, there is zero payoff, none of dynamics at play are resolved. it leaves you empty, i was catching my breath in the climax and then it was all rushed to the end. it could have done with 10-15 more minutes to give us something to grasp on. despite one of the most frustrating endings i have ever experienced, which i don't know if fault lies in the studio or the director, i was thrilled and fascinated for the major part, i still look forward to possible future films if they don't repeat this one's mistakes and i still recommend this adventure ride. as i said my grade is really unindicative at the moment as the balance between good and bad elements i still can't really figure out.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "first things first: i watched the movie in german, i enjoyed the movie a lot, and i haven't played warcraft. before watching the movie, my knowledge of the franchise was very basic and essentially just the premise of the movie: the world of the orcs is dying. they open a portal to the world of humans, azeroth, and try to conquer it for themselves. i'm not going further into story details. the movie plays a bit inside baseball. and the pacing is a fast. if i had to choose, i prefer it to be fast rather than slow, but it could have been a tiny bit slower to drink everything in. it tries to explain a lot of things, so it is a bit \"information overload\" as well. you are also thrown in to new settings and are meant to just accept them. the first few location changes i was constantly thinking \"wait, stop, let me look at it, don't jump to another place, i need some time to understand where we are\". but after a while, you just accept that azeroth is a vast, diverse and big place. i loved the characters of dorutan, draka, orgrim, guldan, medivh, garona and lothar. khadgar grew on me, mainly because i wasn't too fond of the cast actor, but he did a fine job. regarding casting, i had some issues there: i had a hard time believing the queen and lothar are actual siblings. i'm all for diverse casting, but at least give siblings the make ethnicity, okay? also lothar must have been 10 when he became a father. other than that, the cast was okay with me. the names of the characters themselves are a mouthful, and i'm not sure i wrote them correctly. my most favorite character arcs are the ones from dorutan & draka, medivh and surprisingly khadgar. the conflict between orcs and humans, and orcs and orcs is explained well, as is the introduction of the orc race itself. in actuality, the movie tries to give humans and orcs the same amount of screen time and importance and gravitas, but i think everyone will root for the orcs (well, durotan to be precise). they are just so well made and far more interesting than mere humans. it takes itself very serious, with a few jokes here and there. the jokes don't feel out of place, so no cheese-fests like other video game adaptations. i actually liked that a lot, just simply because the setting *hint hint* is an actual war. the visuals are good, but the cgi regarding the background is obvious. i hope on the small screen the cgi won't be as obvious. the orcs look great, though. dwarfs are hilarious and i wish we had seen more of them. elves looked weird, as if they had a cartoon-y glow around them, but they only appear for like 2 scenes. with more screen time i probably would get around it. battle scenes are rough and brutal, something you would expect in an actual war, so don't expect choreographed battles like in most comic book adaptations. a big plus is the active use of spectacular magic in battles. which is extremely stunning: look forward to medhiv, he will become one of your favorites. comparing it to the other big two high fantasy franchises, magic is basically only hinted at and at most very downplayed in the middle earth films, and kind of non-existent in game of thrones. i would say warcraft falls right in between both of those high fantasy franchises. where 'lord of the rings' is a high fantasy story with downplayed magic and a 'let's save the world' 'good-vs- evil' style story, and 'game of thrones' is downplaying fantasy in general with no clear 'good or evil' characters in which anything can happen, warcraft has definitely no set 'good vs bad' theme and anything can happen and it embraces fantasy and magic. the movie is an obvious setup for a franchise, and after watching \"the beginning\" i want to see the sequel. the world is set up and now that everything is introduced, warcraft has the chance to create really good and sophisticated stories. if you are a fan of the high fantasy genre, you should definitely check it out. i enjoyed it a lot. i loved the character development of the main cast and the orcs in general. neither me and my friends played warcraft and we went in for this decade's new \"lord of the rings\" and none of us were disappointed. i personally ranked it 8/10. main issues were pacing and inside baseball. i watched it in german. orcs were speaking in a very bass heavy tone. might be difficult to understand. the german dub is very well done. of course as it always is with dubs, characters/actors loose their accents, which might or might not be a good thing. i can't comment on international voices.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "great film although it's not lotr but i wish

used to take us to that place where we live the moment in middle earth the music the story the feeling, i hope they make the same essence because feelings are universal, any how i consider this film a substitute to the hobbit that failed a bit comparing to lotr but this film brings a promise that the journey begins not ends. my last comment is that warcraft really reflects many things happening in

type of genre recently. and boy, was it surprising to me how much i enjoyed this film, from the incredible visual spectacle that it delivers on, to the tones of family and loyalty, it truly was a 2 hour and 4 minute ride that i would gladly be part of again. the film's tone is completely off the hook in terms of realism, if you are going into this film looking for grounded fantasy in the vein of game of thrones, you are going to be disappointed, this is a world in which magic is the centerpiece and the world colliding conflict is brought upon by an alien race of orcs. if you are looking to get immersed in this over the top and unapologetic world, with a few solid and sometimes tragic characters you will have a good time. some of the cons that the film had from my point of view, fall mainly in the hands of a pacing, due to the grand number of characters is introducing, though not entirely surprising, but unfortunate, the film could use at least another 20 minutes at the start to slowly introduce some of the secondary characters, specially those associated with orc lead durotan and human lead lothar, which by the end of the film the conflict in which they have both taken part of will leave you asking for more. and i truly think this film deserves a more. with the time it had, it did manage to scratch my interest in high fantasy, something that not even ''the hobbit'' films could.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "having lots of experience with warcraft previously makes me obviously biased but i'll be as unbiased as possible. the movie is fun too watch and rarely skips a beat and that's really its downfall in my opinion. even if i know the overarching lore from before i would want to see many parts of it explained and visualized in the movie as many things comes of as pretty unmotivated. there are definitely character development there but it gets rushed too fast not letting it sink in before the next plot device already begins. some subplots also feels unnecessary and kinda detracts from the movie by making it a bit too clich\u00e9 even though most of it is refreshing and kinda daring for a hollywood production. the visuals are great but i lack brutality while they are pushing the pg13 limit to its absolute max i would have preferred heads rolling over discrete sword through stomach deaths. final verdict is an above average film with great visuals and

never quite succeeds in being a fresh submission to the fantasy genre, adding nothing we haven't seen before, but as a video game adaptation it worked surprisingly well! firstly, it's clear duncan jones wanted to make an unbiased story (rather than making the humans the good guys, as standard). they achieved it pretty well too - in fact the most sympathetic character in the whole movie was the main orc durotan (toby kebbell), whose honesty and integrity was superior to the humans, and one of his later scenes provided one of the few truly emotional moments of the film. the other significant character was the incredibly terrifying villain gel'dan, whose magic power was very well animated, despite being slightly vague and unexplained. the other animation, however, wasn't quite so impressive. the orcs and animals look pretty decent but when they move, it doesn't quite work (especially the mouths). the action is mostly well enacted, though the masses of cgi sometimes pushed it to the edge of believability. the magic effects were outstanding though, some of the coolest visuals i've seen in a long time! the sound management was more impressive, from the crunching fight sequences to djawadi's immersive score. it's clear the creators are warcraft fans. they know and love the world they've generated, which means despite the great attention to detail, some elements of the narrative are left slightly under-explained for newcomers like me. the other issue is that the story was disappointingly inconclusive, as if they tried to set up a series rather than making a solid movie. that said, it was certainly enjoyable and a must watch for warcraft fans! 4/5", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i came here to rate this movie simply because i want to go against the mass media hype of \"this movie didn't live up to the standards it should have.\" i am a warcraft player since i was 14. i took my fianc\u00e9 to see the movie with me. she has never even heard of the game franchise, let alone the movie. we both loved it. of course, i loved it more. but that's natural. i felt everything was in place. the cgi effects were used awesomely. the costumes were perfect, right down to the minute details. the acting wasn't crazy special, but it was good enough for the movie. the only thing that could have used a bit more work were the fight scenes. i'm not saying they're bad. they were great. but i felt a \"fight of the film\" was missing. still, i thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of this film. further, it is a great start to what i hope to be a distinct movie chain. so a word of warning, do not follow the comments of mass media. it is my own (personal) perception that most of these movie critics do not know what warcraft is about. furthermore, they try to compare it to lord of the rings. there are literally about three to four reviews comparing it to the lord of the rings movies. i don't get this, sure it's the same genre, but i find it insane that lord of the rings is the benchmark. it's a whole different playing field. then there are reviews saying it was too \"serious.\" it was based on the damn story line. of course it was serious, that's kind of the point. anyway, long story short, go watch this movie, and bring whoever you want (warcraft fan or not). they will enjoy it too.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i watched this movie

must watch for the fans of all of the warcraft games, and for those film lovers out there. great for everyone.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "honestly, the first point i want to make before going in depth is that in no way am i a professional reviewer and i am simply writing this review because i feel a lot of the reviews written for this movie, have been based off of subjective opinion rather than us looking at it for what it is, a movie franchise with what might be the greatest potential in the 21st century. now, for all of you still reading, let's start off with some facts. blizzard entertainment first introduced warcraft, to consoles in warcraft: orcs & humans in 1994, the following year they then released warcraft ii: tides of darkness and the expansion warcraft ii: beyond the dark portal 1995, then it took them another 7 years before the sequel warcraft iii: reign of chaos (roc) came out in 2002 followed closely by warcraft iii: the frozen throne (tft) in 2003. the year after that is when world of warcraft was released, which in its opening year had 1.5 million people subscribing, now to world of warcraft alone there currently are 5 expansions and a 6th on the way. the movie warcraft: the beginning is about the very first game that dates all the way back to warcraft: orcs & humans. with all this in mind, let's explore what has been done to bring the world of warcraft to life on the cinematized screen of a movie theatre. to start off, i'd like to say, i have been anticipating the release of this movie for almost going on 3 years now, and back in 2014 when i noticed it on imdb for pre-production it said it wouldn't be out until in 2017, so being here in 2016 having watched it on the premiere date too, i'd say i'm more than ecstastic. now, what i as both a player of the game, and a fan of the lore experienced is, keeping in mind that it is a work to be critical about, am very pleased with the result. what i think we all noticed during the first release of the trailer is that the production team kept the animated look to the pauldrons and armor of the humans, because they wanted to illustrate how this is a fictional world, where magic roams, where creatures you'd never dream of in your wildest nightmares also walk freely. a lot of people are also criticizing the use of cgi in this movie, but, the fact that all cgi-characters were based on motion capture, where the actions were performed by actual actors in suits, made it not only exceed the expectations but create an entire new plateau for what people in the future will expect from cgi. and as a moviebuff i am personally really invested in that concept and idea, and i think we all should be. with all this being said, and not much of the actual movie having been revealed, i'd like to extend an invitation to anyone who hasn't seen this marvel with their own eyes, to go see it, because not only do i believe, but i know for a fact that if people see this movie and dislike it, it's not because of what's been shown on the screen, it's more likely they're perplexed by the fact that their expectations to the movie were wrong.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "never before have we had a good video game movie. look at the super mario bros. movie, the hit-man movie and the street fighter movie, what do they have in common? they all suck. so when i initially heard of the warcraft movie i was skeptical to say the least, in fact i was terrified they would ruin the legacy of my most played game. boy was i wrong, what i got was exactly what i dreamed of, it was perfect in every way. why? what differs this from all the other video game movies? pure passion; all the other movies are just cash grabs, promotions for the game, but this was written and directed by a warcraft player and it clearly shows. the cities and environments are like those in game, the characters are some what like those in games (they have his own interpretation of them and that's ok, it's a good one) and the dialogue has a warcraft feel, this movie certainly seems to bring the game to life, all warcraft players must to see this, it is a marvelous tribute to the game. the complaints i heard from critics is that it went too fast, this raised issues such as not being able to bond with characters and not getting the full feel of the environment. unfortunately this is the case but in my opinion it was essential to the movie. it gave the universe a large, expansive feel, the fast pace of the movie shows how gargantuan the warcraft world actually is and how many important characters there are. sure it could be difficult to some to understand but i don't think it is too bad that you can't enjoy or understand the movie, for me and my friends (some who have never played warcraft) this was not an issue. the cgi and effects are just godly. it actually looks real, the orcs look like they are real and it is just spectacular. the mortal kombat movie was ok in my opinion but due to the effects i don't think it holds up well, however this movie was just perfect, if the cgi was bad this movie would straight up fail but due to the effects this movie will hold up for a long time. not much to say about the effects apart from how good they are to be honest. the soundtrack is epic, nothing wrong here either. it has a very fantasy, warcraft feel as it has remixed some of the world of warcraft tracks (such as the stormwind theme) and the way they are used in the movie gives it a very epic feel and really makes you root for the people fighting, again not a lot to say apart from awesome. in conclusion; i only have good things to say about this movie (apart from it feeling fast which i personally disregard), the effects and cgi really make this movie feel real and epic while the passion in the writing and directing flare to make this the first ever good video game movie. as a warcraft player i must say it is just what i wanted and can't argue with anything and my friends who don't play warcraft seemed to have enjoyed the movie equally as i have. i will finish with this; usually in movies i sit there with a straight face and think about the movie as it is before me, however here i couldn't resist smiling throughout the whole thing as i was so excited and pleased with what this movie turned out to be.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "as a warcraft fan, i was very pleased with the final product and i really think this is a good movie. i won't get into details about the movie, as i don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but i can say a few things: story -although the story of the movie is not 100% faithful to the original lore, the changes made are plausible and were laid out in a consistent and credible way; -this movie is about a fantasy world, and as a fantasy story, i am of the opinion that this is a very good story, very entertaining and immersive; -there were loads of funny moments, with fairly-clich\u00e9 jokes and lots of easter eggs for the fanbase; -i think that duncan jones did an overall very good work with the script and directing the movie, he made choices and some people might like them, others won't, but solid story and acting nonetheless; acting -the main characters in the film were very personable and while some people might relate more with durotan, orgrim or draka, and others will relate more with lothar or garona, all the audience can relate to some character because they have the same sort problems real people have on a daily basis \u0096 as i said, they're personable; -on the other end of the spectrum, the \"bad guys\" (blackhand, gul'dan) are typical bad guys but ben foster was quite good at fleshing out medivh's fight between his good and bad (corrupt) sides; -i'm not going to pretend i'm a huge expert in acting and have the ability to say what is and isn't good acting, but i can say if i felt actor a or actress b performed in a way that i felt was convincing or portrayed the character in a way it made me like that character. with that said, my personal opinion is that paula patton surprised me with garona and i loved every scene of rob kazinsky's orgrim. the character i liked the most was khadgar, closely followed by gul'dan and durotan. so kudos to ben schnetzer, daniel wu and toby kebbel, you made credible and strong performances. a word of appreciation to tom clancy, ruth negga and anna galvin, i would've liked to have seen more of blackhand, lady taria and draka, respectively; -in parallel, i felt dominic cooper and travis fimmel to be a bit disconnected as i couldn't really feel much connection to king llane and lothar, respectively; pace -the pace of the movie is quite fast, which can lead to some people who aren't familiar with the lore to feel a bit lost here and there. however, one has to understand that the movie is based on a story that was written over many books and whenever you make any movie based on a book, there is no other way than stripping out a lot of detail from the book(s), else you'd have a 10h-long movie. the same thing happened with lord of the rings trilogy, where a lot of fans criticized the movie for only showing a very small amount of what was in the book; -for the same reason, there are several points in the movie where scenes were laid out to support sequels and those are obvious for those who know the lore, and left the feeling that this will lead somewhere for those who don't. i think this was a good move, this movie literally screams for sequels. yes, i used plural, one sequel is not enough; graphics -i deliberately left this aspect to the end because i think it is a cornerstone of this movie. there's only one way i can define the cg used in the movie and that is: amazing! no, seriously, i always thought to myself and said it many times \u0096 if the guys doing the movie get the orcs right, they already won. and that's exactly what happened in this movie. the orcs are simply awesome! they look real, credible, even in scenes with hundreds/thousands of orcs, and surprisingly personable! you can easily relate with these huge beasts who are very aggressive and all, but happen to have feelings; -the magic in the movie is absolutely amazing and credible, i wish we had magic effects like this in-game! this was extremely surprising, it's so much better than any other magic effects i've seen in any other movie, ever!; - the landscapes are breathtaking, to say the least. even if you don't know the locations, they're still very eye-candy; -i would go as far as saying that ilm did such a good job on the cgi that warcraft: the beginning's graphics are probably the best i've ever seen in any movie, definitely better than the ones we saw on movies like avatar or planet of the apes; sound -all the music and sound effects are top notch, especially the tone of the orcs' voice, really thundering strong voices! for all of the reasons stated above, i'd say this is quite a good movie to see and i will definitely see it more than once. if i would advise anyone to do anything, was to go see the movie and form your own opinion. you might agree or disagree entirely or partially with me, this is just my personal opinion. but please don't dispute anything said above if you haven't seen the movie yourself. criticizing something lacking knowledge, just based on someone else's opinion is just plain stupid. yes, it wasn't the most enlightening movie of all time that changed my life entirely from a philosophical standpoint, it's not an oscar/grammy/whatever awards you prefer contender, but it's definitely a very good entertaining fantasy movie with awesome special effects that anyone in your family can actually see and feel connected to. for that, i'd give it a solid 7/10 rating and advise everyone to go see it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i'm a film lover. i have also played a considerable amount of warcraft in the past. this is to say i wasn't sure if i could write an honest review of the film, not because i feel biased towards the warcraft universe, but simply because i might subconsciously understand a lot more of what is going when compared to someone who hasn't been in contact with the games. with that said, warcraft is a good film. starting with the good: characterisation. a lot of fantasy films fail because we can't relate to the characters. warcraft pulls it off. you immediately sympathize with the characters in both factions. balance. you don't really get to pick a side here, there is no such thing as \"these are the good guys, those are the bad guys\". both sides bring strong characters to the table, characters you can relate to. the alliance is lead by men who put the well of their people first. the horde is lead by a villain, but the orcs show they value honor the most, and it becomes clear throughout the film that change is coming to the horde. the art and cgi. it's loyal to the games and fans. anyone that has played the games will find plenty to relate to here. from full blown environments and scenery, the cities, the spell effects, the orcs, the human armor, the weaponry, the little details here and there... it's clear this was made out of the love and respect for the franchise. the excellent: durotan. what a character, you completely forget about the cgi here. a 5* star performance from toby kebbell and the art team. the bad: it's fast paced. maybe it's hard to get around this, there is only so much you are allowed to fit in. i guess that if you're a fan, it's easier to follow and you already \"know\" a lot of what is going on... i can imagine this will be a bit harder for the rest of the audience. it might just feel a bit too much at times. travis fimmel. don't get me wrong, i think he is a great actor - i just have a problem understanding him at times! i've been a fan of him since vikings, but the man needs to step up his voice, speech lessons, whatever. it's hard to understand the man. all in all, warcraft pulls it off extremely well. i do hope it performs well enough so we can see future sequels, fans know the best is yet to come: there are amazing stories and characters the \"rest\" of the world needs to

somewhat mixed expectations - partially low due to 'the video game curse', the heavy lore behind warcraft (very, very little of it which i know) and also partially high because blizzard (the company behind the franchise) makes amazing games with incredible stories and attention to detail and due to duncan jones', albeit small, prior efforts at directing movies. this movie is truly unlike you've ever seen before! seeing a grand adventure world like this come sprawling to life being made mostly with cgi and motion capture is utterly amazing. i know, i know.. too much cgi is never a good thing, and i'm usually in that camp too, but put these orcs in lord of the rings costumes and makeup then duncan jones would never have been able to capture the essence of their 'humanity', the feelings wouldn't show and alas they would be nothing but unrelatable scary monsters. the point of this film is to do exactly the opposite. duncan and the actors behind the motion capture manage to hit the nail on this one! the story is great, grand and adventures. it feels like a proper fantasy through and through, epic in scale and enormous in stakes. one can't help but end up rooting for both sides of this conflict. magic is everything in a fantasy, and finally getting to see what a true wielder of the arcane arts is capable of is like a nerd wet dream come true. gosh how i love the magic and the sheer scale of it in this movie is incredible. it is finally so good to see it done on a large and forceful scale in a movie! i didn't stop smiling once during this movie, utterly entertaining and amazing eye candy. the movie isn't pure goodness though - warcraft is filled to the brink with characters, some are properly introduced some aren't, some with motivations which aren't fully explained and the lack thereof can make one a confused. the amount of characters being balanced in this movie are a bit too many, but then again, trying to please an already established and demanding fan base can't be anything but tricky. the specifics of the lore are impossible to learn through the movie, so be ready to do some digging once you've seen it. it is action packed! both for the better and worse. there are few times where this movie really slows down and lets you wallow in this beautiful and realized world, which is a shame. it can really take your breath away be it by exhaustion or the

point of view of a long time warcraft player as well as someone who might be unfamiliar with the source material. the movie is edited badly, there is no real sense of time lapse in it. the characters are all over the world within minutes between each scene and it causes an unrealistic presentation of how large the world actually is and how fast these characters can travel from one place to another. while the movie wanted to keep the focus on many different characters at the same time, they could have made a slower and more realistic approach where some events could have simply been mentioned rather than presented. the cgi is great, however it only looks great next to other cgi. inexperienced viewers won't notice this much, however the cgi definitely stands out when real objects come into scene such as the actors. for the most part they've done a great job at making it all look as real as possible, but towards the end when there is a orc vs human battle in front of the dark portal, it got a bit sloppy. the acting appeared to be \"okay\" for the most part, however the person who plays khadgar definitely had some issues. he never seems quiet into it and comes across pretty self aware. the aesthetic of the movie tries to copy the game nearly 100%. it's subjective whether this is a good or a bad thing, but i did not think it was a good decision. in a movie, the ridiculous and silly objects such as house sized anvils and shoulder armor twice as big as the wearers head looks the way they should, very very silly. they might have kept the style yet tried to make it seem a bit more grounded to decrease the silliness of it all. though this is subjective. the fight between medivh and the others are, to put it simply, clumsy. it was sloppy and wasn't the fight the story deserved. with khadgar and lothar playing around with the silly clay monster and medivh just walking around chanting. it might have been best for them to stick to the actual story where medivh puts an aging curse on khadgar and gets stabbed through the chest, causing the demon sargeras to slowly emerge and get it's head chopped off. it is simpler and more direct. the way it is in the movie was simply too silly. generally speaking, the best parts of the movie were those of the interactions within the orc society. the drama was there, the struggle was there and most of the development was there also. the same care was absent from the human side of the story, having a very forced and unemotional death scene for lothar's son as well as an awkwardly revealed secret of medivh's possession. no matter my opinion, it appears the movie is set to have a sequel, and hopefully they will address most of these issues. personally i would try to reduce the silliness aspect of the aesthetic and try to have there be more focus on the story so the characters don't just jump around so much. also there should be more explanation for those who are not familiar with the story. a movie can't survive only with fan service.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "1. movies 2. music 3. television 4. books 5. games this is how the world perceives each industry in order of popularity, fame, wealth, coolness and sophistication.. the lower down the list the harder it is to make the transition upwards. gaming is still to this day considered 'for children' by so called peers of the realm which makes it very difficult for a feature film of even one of gaming's most recognisable adult based, story/lore rich brands to receive credibility.. in my opinion, the movie industry for some reason is truly terrified of the gaming industry most of all.. and if a 'game' were to ever achieve success in the movie industry the world as we know it may (end) change and gamer's perhaps would be somewhat forgiven/understood for spending (wasting) their free time within these worlds.. as for this movie, i had my doubts to begin with but when i learned just exactly how much influence blizzard were going to have, i relaxed.. basing the movie on the original game was a risky but genius move.. unquestionably there are much more entertaining stories and events within the 'warcraft' universe but starting from the beginning just feels so right and that is what i feel this movie has achieved, something which blizzard are known for.. fantastic storytelling.. i personally feel the pace of the movie is acceptable because there was so much to get through and even if your not a fantasy fan you can easily understand the premises of this movie and because of this frantic pace i can hand on heart confirm that there are precisely zero dull scenes within this because they simply didn't have time to include some.. the actors and travis fimmel in particular were completely suitable and portrayed lothar exactly how i would imagine him to be which is pretty special for an actor who has very little knowledge of the universe.. the cast as a whole were perfect for this as none of them are considered 'huge household names' which could have taken away some of the focus from 'warcraft' itself.. as for the cgi environments and the orcs i am not going to waste my time reviewing because this is blizzard, they know their product well.. yes the movie could have been improved but without a new hope you would never have had empire.. this is a solid and impressive 'beginning'.. please go and

it is a good possibility that people with no prior knowledge of this universe will have a hard time connecting a few dots. that's because warcraft pushes the story nearly too much and ducan jones

it, understandably, the fans and non-fans like it, also understandably. who is right? both\u0085 alright, so let's just put the premise of this whole thing. a film adaptation, for a game, still a very tricky thing to do which could easily go wrong, and did for many tries in the past. it has to be appealing for the fans, non-fans, for movie goers, avatar movie-like fanatics, snobbish people, adults and children etc. and just then we still didn't get to the fact, that it is a movie, and it has to tell a story from a to b, having a structure, in which a movie should work. we're living in an age where a film adaptation for a game has finally managed to bring exactly the same image which the game itself represents, well, in a way. some are saying it's not a world of warcraft movie, i say it is, kinda, mixed with the warcraft i's simplicity, creating a hybrid which tells a simple but important story for this franchise, introducing elements which may be important for the latter storytelling. it's indeed a beginning for possible sequels, just as it should be after several ones were released in the format of books, and games, summing up massive lore, from which the film makers could choose and put as a sequel next to this really ambitious, and overall well made movie; warcraft, the beginning. it couldn't be that easy to bring all the feelings, experiences which we could come by in games, or in the world of literature. that's merely impossible, that's why i think that without duncan jones' talent this movie couldn't work, which want to tell many things yet it still don't. it starts to bring up information which should be noted, but in the end, their role and part will only be seen in the future somewhere, so now they only take participation in making the represented world believable and credible, creating the atmosphere the game itself has. it may have been made for the fans, but it also could be appealing for non- fans, however the truth is, each side will take the communications of this movie differently, 'coz no matter what, some pre-knowledge wouldn't hurt to really get the movie's real intention. it may be liked by non-fans, and the uninitiated, the information they collect from this 2 hour story restores whole differently as in a fan, or a viewer, who has played some time with any of the games. so in my opinion, the real quality could be experienced if you have some knowledge about the franchise, whether it is from the written format or gaming platform. because no matter what, the world of warcraft is a grotesque but still a dangerous place, it's as serious as it is not, it holds as dark moments as light ones, and this is a language that warcraft held with itself from the beginning of its existence. so when a guy, like medivh speaks totally seriously about the fel magic, as the camera holds the position on his face, it is as serious as cringe-worthy, it's someplace in between, and that's the simple reflection of the world of warcraft's language, when you look at the orcs, they are not just scary, they are also adorable in a way with their huge hands and tusks, with their simple perspective of life, when we see lothar, a totally cheeky appearance throughout a film showing off how deadly and sullen can he be in the end. however some changes have been made in order to make the movie work, so in some percentage it really doesn't matter what your pre-conceptions are, a partly new story will be shown in front of you, and here is the answer what a film adaptation for a game should be, in my opinion: be true to the source, but also make purpose to bring it on screen. how could be that possible? simply with thinking a bit outside the box, understanding how could the elements of a game work on big screen in order to bring new experiences for the audience, making it clear what's the difference between communicating information by the game and the movie. familiar faces, names, stories, a bit differently, bringing back memories from the past in a form of modern communication, and the language of motion picture. we see what we expect to see, yet get it in a whole lot of different pacing that we got used to watching any cinematics made in this franchise, experiencing a story, that has heart, and soul, an ambitious production which possibly holds many surprises and also nostalgic feelings\u0085 so simply put, warcraft: the beginning is a fresh and solid experience, giving a good fun to the audience, that may not be a masterpiece, or legendary, far from that, but as a movie adaptation for a game it is a pleasant momentum, and for a start\u0085 it is sufficient. just let us see some effect of elevation or evolution for the sequels. p.s.: they say that 40 minutes footage was cut out from the full length, maybe that's why it is a bit chaotic in several places... so we better get a director's cut. oh, i cannot wait to see the lord of the clans.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "when i saw

didn't feel like over the top cgi-dance routines. they had risk and intensity. though i must admit, that a certain character did have a bit too much plot armor. as far as the story goes; it was overall interesting. i enjoyed the double perspective and world building elements. there were however problems in the plot transitioning. the exposition and early phases of the movie are quite lacking. it's all too fast paced and certain points, that should have been explained more thoroughly earlier only got to me after they kept bringing them up as the plot progressed. the acting was pretty good and you could sense some dedication within the portrayals of the characters. while the story was not too heavily character driven, they did deliver in being somewhat interesting to stick

critics at all. this movie is by far better than the critics want it to be. this movie has so much love and details, it is breathtaking. you can tell, in every scene, how close the film is to the source material. especially for the fans who know all the small pieces and were like: \"omg! it is exactly like in the game.\" the acting was okay, far from being as horrible as described. i actually liked khadgar's more clumsy appearance which visibly lightened the overall very dark tone of the movie. and ben foster as medivh actually played surprisingly convincing. the orcs all acted flawlessly via motion-capture. the cgi was top notch. the orcs look better than avatar, so does the overall cgi (for the budget). the cgi environments were a feast for the eyes. again, the fans will love it because they recognize every single detail of it. stormwind, the forest, deadwind pass, dalaran. everything looks so familiar. the set pieces were lovely crafted and there were more than i expected. every interior was at least partly real. the pacing was no problem for me, as i did pay attention throughout the film. i got myself into the setting and some concepts and then it works. the overall story was okay with some nice twists. not oscar-worthy, but compelling. it is a good vs. evil story but with some heavy twists to the standard fantasy formula. about the orcs. oh boy. the orcs are all outstanding. very likable ( or not ;) ). gul'dan and blackhand are just as bad-ass as durotan and orgrim. and fans will see a very important character in the background for future films. there are emotional scenes but they could have been a tad more emotional. the death scenes especially were too emotionless. yes, it can get confusing if you do not know anything about the warcraft universe. 10 minutes more would have been okay to explain some stuff a bit more. and would have guaranteed higher ratings. i do not trust the us critics anymore. no a single one. they clearly do not know what they are reviewing. they are far from being realistic. everything that is 'only' okay is panned. this is unrealistic. \"unrealistic movie\" - it is high fantasy! \"smb the movie is better\" - eh what?! \"the movie is racist\" - there are at least 3 black actors (soldier, taria, garona). \"the movie is too serious\" - is lotr or got that humorous? and there is no trump in the film either, dear the

humans are not so compelling.. travis fimmell as lothar is not as good as i though, and garona i think the name, is not as interesting as i though, but its still my opinion.. there are some things

visuals and amazing effects invite you to the fantastic and beautiful world you know from the games. first of all i have to say that i am a big fan of the warcraft franchise, but i am not that fond of the lore, especially the lore of the beginnings which is pictured in this movie. so i don't know if there is a lot of discrepancy to the original lore, but frankly that also doesn't really matter to me. in terms of story the movie is not outstanding, but it is good and the characters are written and played well for the most part. it is not told out of only one perspective, which makes you see the motives of both sides and both are not plain good or plain evil, even though there is a main antagonist to the story. coming to the characters as such, most of the actors fit their characters, had logical motives and made me empathize for them. the only flaw for me was ben foster as medivh. he didn't do a really bad job and the role also wasn't badly written, but i think he doesn't really fit the role. but again i don't know the original lore. he just seemed unfitting for me. especially because the rest fit their roles very well, most notably the orcs, who looked and were played amazing, both motion captured or live acted. which leads me to my third and for this movie most important and best part: the visuals warcraft manages to dazzle you almost every second during the entire movie with it's incredible beauty and visual effects. the places you visit all seem real and you feel like you're coming home to the world you know from the games, because it looks just the same, but more beautiful and real. everything is so detailed and gorgeous, you can really feel the love and fandom, that went into this movie. the battles and there are quite a few of them are very well choreographed and you never feel like it's just another movie fight. to sum it up, you should definitely watch this movie, especially, if you're a fan of the warcraft franchise, because it takes the warcraft universe and puts it into a mainly visually stunning film with good lore behind it. and of course the movie is full of fan service for the people who know this franchise for a long time. i don't know how people who aren't in familiar with the warcraft lore in any way will take this movie but for fans it is most definitely a must see in my opinion and i can not wait for another one.",

thoroughly, given more depth. this way it feels like it cuts off too fast from certain events. the music was bloody marvelous. accompanies the ongoing action perfectly. definitely going to get my hands on the full ost. not even going to talk about the cgi, because everyone already said that it is mind blowing, which i completely agree with. (even though i watched it in regular 3d, not imax) now, as for the story, for fans, there is a lot of things that are changed, aka not canon within the lore. the changes are not absurd and they fit pretty well with the movie. i actually ended up preferring some of the changes to the canon stuff, even though one certain deviation kinda left me unsatisfied. the action/fight scenes are done with an amazing level of detail to them. even with the lack of detailed character introduction, you still easily connect to them. there are many emotional scenes, and there is a particular one that literally left me speechless and a bit teary- eyed. overall, i rate it a solid 9/10", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "unlike the critic's epic fail in giving this movie a fair review, warcraft was an epic win for blizzard. warcraft is not the usual crappy video game spin-off movie, it feels and plays like it was meant for the big screen. in general, blizzard made the movie while keeping the fans in mind giving priority to their needs (as it should be) rather than dumbing down the lore for random moviegoer. yet, for the non-fans it does not disappoint. warcraft bring to the table a series of epic battle and dilemmas that will keep you engaged throughout the 2 hour run time. if you have no prior exposure to the warcraft universe there are 3 major aspects that warcraft does better in than any other movie of its genre. dare i say it does better in them than lotr did. 1. magic. warcraft does not have your typical wise gray bearded wizard who sits on his ass all day reading, and when the situation becomes dire, he flashes in and save the day. nor is it gandalf who can blast enemies away by just swinging his staff. in warcraft, a huge variety of magic can be witnessed. incantations are used, mages can use the elements arcane, frost,and fire to fend for themselves in battle. on the other hand, warlocks can use fel magic that feeds of life itself to cast dangerous yet powerful spells to aid them in battle. magic and its various types are easily seen in warcraft. also, mages are not the old man in the pointy hat, they are young people who sharpen there skills in direct combat on the battle field, whether its with other mages or fully armored warriors. moreover, mages are not invincible as they can be jumped, captured or incapacitated via conventional means. 2. battles. another plus for warcraft are the battles that were fought. the orcs fleeing a dying world try to invade another to survive. they then send a small warband to pave the way, and ensure the rest of the horde can make it to azeroth. amazingly (sarcasm) the small warband follows a logical strategy of warfare, as we would expect from creature raised in a culture of war. the orcs acknowledge their small numbers stick to swift raids and ambushes to fight the enemy. the most satisfying part of the battles is that these hulking monsters are not massacred by the humans with relative ease like lotr. surprisingly the orcs fight like hulking beasts would do by using brute force to crush the enemy. the humans who never encountered orcs before try to adapt to orcs and slowly start to put up a fight. 3. orcs. last but defiantly not least, orcs. just to make things clear orcs in warcraft are not the inherently evil orcs and uruks of lotr. in warcraft, orcs have there own culture, architecture, language, free will, and the respect for tradition. the tribal orcs of draenor did not unite and invade azeroth purely for blood lust. the path they took was out of desperation as their world collapsed, it was necessary to ensure the survival of their race (you would understand this better if you played the game as it was not explained well in the movie). another thing warcraft does well is that they show how barbaric these orcs are, but they do not cross the thin line and mix it with being evil, and the viewer can clearly see this distinction between evil and a barbaric way of life. as a result of this, the viewer will adore some orcs while deeply despising others. other than the stunning cgi, these features distinguished warcraft from other fantasies, and could be appreciated by all viewers. (some viewers my find the movie clich\u00e9, but remember, the story came out in 1994 as the first warcraft game was released. orcs having their own way of life and are not necessarily evil was pretty original back then.) fans, with prior knowledge of what will happen and where the story is going will be greeted warmly by the movie. as the lore does not explain itself a lot, blizzard had more time to insert easter eggs for the fans to spot, while the characters venture through familiar locations were all wow (world or warcraft) players have visited. also, due to the small time invested in explaining the lore we as fans are treated to ambushes, raids, and epic battles unfold similar to the battle of warcraft iii roc intro. blizzard has given us a movie that any fantasy lover could enjoy, and fans who already know the lore could relate to as everything unfolds. regrettably, no movie is perfect and in warcraft, a lot of the cast members aren't familiar with acting in a fantasy movie (dominic cooper). sometimes emotions are not present were they are needed the most. the lore was not explained well as there was no time (again the movie was for the fans), so some viewers may be lost and not know completely whats happening. a personal dislike i had for the movie is that they changed a small part of the lore for dramatic purposes (it is a movie after all) that as a die hard fan of the lore i didn't appreciate. all-in-all the movie was amazing and its not worth missing, whether you're a fan of not.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "as someone who's never heard of the game until this movie came out, i honestly loved the movie. the cgi was beautiful and the relation to each character was real, the world itself felt so real. i could feel strong emotions even from the orcs which was a big plus for me, usually most movies that have \"monsters\" in them are too focused on how evil they look and don't show emotion. i was actually really attracted to the orc side of the story. loved duncan jones movie \"moon\" so i had no doubt he would be able to pull out another great movie. i am going to take my kids to watch this movie again, also my wife hates fantasy movies but i convinced her to go and she actually really liked warcraft. kudos!

world indeed. strip star wars of its often striking images and its high-falutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a \"future\" cast to them.\" [...] \"o dull new world! we are treated to a galactic civil war, assorted heroes and villains, a princely maiden in distress, a splendid old man surviving from an extinct order of knights who possessed a mysterious power called \"the force,\" and it is all as exciting as last year's weather reports.... why, even the most exciting fight is an old-fashioned duel, for all that the swords have laser beams for blades....\" i think this can be enough to get the idea, now go watch the movie and decide for yourself. as a side note, i can see how those who are not familiar with the saga universe could fail in grasping its value, and could feel bewildered, and could scorn it as \"random bulls**t\", but that's not the case, quite the opposite, duncan knows what he's doing. for those unfamiliar with it, you need to know that the warcraft games are a kitsch mishmash of tolkien, dungeons & dragons, everything that's fantasy and sci fi and comics...you name it. all with really exaggerated and over the top aesthetics. nonetheless it has some \"magic\" quality that hooked million of us and made us dream. so no point in complaining about the \"unrealistic armors\" or the \"derivative\" nature of it and other stuff like that. that's warcraft, and duncan nailed it with astonishing skill. i also believe the two really dense hours of running time are not enough to clear the nature of what is being presented (characters and motives) to newbies. what you can see as newcomers is just a glimpse of what's coming, but if you can trust the director, you're gonna enjoy it (i suspect that the 40 mins of footage that were cut out could help making it more accessible to newcomers). warcraft is not perfect, it has flaws (like many movies we now regard as masterpieces), but it is an impressive piece of work, it's innovative, it has a soul, it's got style, it's hugely fun. it's clearly just a setup for what's coming next, and i can't wait to see the rest. btw... extended

movie will not review well, however, by the usual critics as it has a number of easy to pile upon issues which cannot justify an all-positive review. however, should we get a sequel this movie is just

if you want to see stormwind or dalaran appear on big screen, they are a sight to behold. costumes are amazing. orcs are huge and feel real. warcraft even makes magic look and feel real. what an immersive visuals and sound effects. i count is as a positive but it may be divisive for some: this movie is not for kids. this movie is brutal, serious and has scenes of torture, vicious deaths and just pure evil. i was not expecting this movie to have this level of seriousness and brutality. apart from two clear comic relief scenes, this movie is making a very grounded and believable world out of magic portals, griffons and flying cities. no \"zug-zug\" orcs in here, only scary brutal (and sometimes honourable) orcs. this movie is tougher than lord of the rings by far and these is the most brutal fantasy probably brought to big screen (at least mainstream) so far. the overall plot in its design is also good. this is not a story which falls apart when you think about it. everything sounds proper and character actions make sense. a lot of care went into this movie, and it's clear that the director duncan jones loves this franchise. did i mention orcs were scary? gul'dan is the evilest villain that marvel ever hoped to get into one of their movies. this shaman is just terrifying and a threat which is both palpable and his heinous acts always hit hard. the twist in the end which obviously sets up for sequels is very clever, the whole design of plot, the dialogue are all very well written. and now straight to what holds this movie back: while the plot is good in design, its execution is not stellar. the plot and dialogue are \"too well written\" to the point of being unrealistic at times. the movie has clear pacing problems: after a promising intro scene, the first act moves a bit too much between the locations. we go from ironforge to stormwind and then to meet the king in goldshire (why??) within minutes. in the second act everything slows to a crawl and this is the single biggest flaw of this movie. without anything to break a litany of dialogues i had time to actually notice other issues, the most important of which is that emotional scenes fall between \"flat\" and \"utterly predictable\". it speaks loudly when the most interesting and emotionally well-acted character is cgi orc durotan. his scenes with his wife, his friend and his son are the emotional highlights of the movie. the human actors do very poorly in this regard. garona and lothar romance is a mistake and should've been at best a respectful friendship between warriors. i hope after zootopia studios will understand that there are other forms of interaction between male and female leads other than romantic involvement. during the movie's second slow act it also become apparent that the whole seriousness of the movie may be a bit too much and a comic relief would be nice. lothar went to sarcasm 101 class, the skill he shows off often to his mage friend khadgar. however, it's not nearly enough. khadgar gets a single truly funny scene in the movie (hint: polymorph) which begs the questions: why is there only one and why does it come so late in the movie? music is a hit and miss. i was initially sold when i heard a hint of the stormwind theme in the beginning of the movie ,but, once again, the more emotional tunes are missing from the orchestra. it tries to highlight the realism by going for \"less is more\" which definitely works during brutal (you gotta see it just for the fight scenes) combat, but the rest of the movie begs for more. and here it is. in a nutshell, the movie excels at visual design and combat scenes, but it's seriousness and slow pace can wear you down. it's a solid 7 at least, in my book, for non-warcraft fans and 9/10 for me personally because so many warcraft things were done right. don't go expecting the moon and you'll be pleasantly surprised.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "out of all the movies i've seen this year, warcraft sticks out like a sore thumb (and that's coming from someone who doesn't play the games). but like i'm emo and i really want that sore thumb to be there (terrible analogy).warcraft has an great array of layered, sympathetic characters with deep personalities and motivations however ben schnetzer (khadgar) stole the show for me. i had never heard of this guy before but now i can't wait to see where his career is headed. with that said, there is one actor that didn't sell for me and that's travis fimmel (anduin lothar). it's particularly frustrating because he is very much the main character and, while his character is very layered, he would have made for an excellent side character. but what really was the big kicker of this movie was the score. game of thrones composer ramin djawadi once again delivers a powerful theme that's been stuck in my head ever since. also, the visuals are great... most of the time. the digitally-created orcs are the most believable cgi creations

wouldn't actually give the movie 10/10 if it weren't for 2 things; the way it is executed and my passion about warcraft, gaming and fantasy. there were a few things in the movie that i felt were slightly lacking. i mean, i would still have given it 8 or 9. i raise the score to 10 because of how the movie is executed. the fight scenes and battles were truly amazing, even though they're not as epic as they could have been. to make up for that, the movie provided an epic utilization of magic and spells - i was blown away by this! with everything considered, including that it is a game-to-movie adaptation, i can't help but to feel that it is somewhat revolutionary. to me it was an unique experience, just like when i watched movies/series such as the matrix, the lord of the

reading the terrible reviews, and not being a fan of the world of warcraft games, i went into this movie with very low expectations. initially, the low expectations seemed to be appropriate. the movie introduces a number of different characters in a rather haphazard way, barely explaining what they do or why we should care. similarly, there's very little world building in the beginning, and people are just expected to have a basic understanding of how things in the warcraft universe fit together. pretty quickly, though, the movie launches into a surprisingly compelling plot. unlike many other movies in the genre (lord of the rings, for example) doesn't just focus on the human (or \"good\") side, but explains the back story of the orcs, and gives them personality and motivation. after a lackluster start, the movie manages to give the characters at least some depth, and despite having a pretty large cast, almost everybody has at least some character development. technically, this movie is flawless. the amount of work that must have gone into creating the warcraft universe in this movie must have been incredible. the attention to detail is breathtaking. in scenes where dozens and dozens of orcs are shown, every single one looks unique, and has his (or her) own characteristics and movements. the world in which the movie takes place is beautiful, and the fight choreographs are amazing. the colorful world in which the movie takes place defies the grim-dark trend in recent years, where even superman movies have to be sad and dark and rainy, and that alone makes warcraft a refreshing joy to watch. despite being quite long, the movie always moves ahead at a brisk pace, and manages to convey a ton of plot. in short, this is a really well made, very entertaining movie. it has its flaws, particularly in the beginning, but i truly enjoyed every second of it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "as someone who only tried the game once or twice or thrice, i surprisingly enjoyed this rather clunky yet strangely enjoyable film. it's a pretty straightforward narrative that it doesn't wastes its time introducing much of its world. you gotta accept whatever you see; whether it's warlocks or orcs or whatever, the movie just embraces its world and trusts the audience to follow through. it kind of makes sense why those who were familiar with the game appreciated this more than standard film critics, but again, i'm not a big fan of warcraft, but i can get immediately invested to this fantasy world (and i like fantasy stuff.) yeah, some moments feel a little too rushed, i don't want to use the term contrived since the movie does earn some of those moments, allowing itself to establish the arcs of these characters, but it's paced a little too quick that it doesn't spend much time to breathe for a little more gravity on its story choices. this is a big story sustained in a two hour runtime, so it's a tough choice. the aesthetics however, while often being criticized for being too video game looking (yeah, isn't it obvious?) actually looks pretty neat. at times, it looks sort of uncinematic, but the scale it provides just brings an exciting sense of adventure to it. the acting is fine, there are worse ways you can expect from a video game adaptation, but here, you can actually care for these characters. warcraft is flawed for sure, but to what it is, it remains to be kind of fun. i can see why many aren't impressed for this film, so far, it will perplex to those who cannot dive into this mythology and again, the storytelling feels a little too quick, but the movie is careless to be concerned to those things that it has become both a benefit and a problem for its own good. as a first part of a series (hopefully) it's actually a solid try. there are problems you just can't avoid, but there are still a lot of admirable choices to appreciate, in the end.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "i went it to warcraft with somewhat mixed expectations - partially low due to 'the video game curse', the heavy lore behind warcraft (very, very little of it which i know) and also partially high because blizzard (the company behind the franchise) makes amazing games with incredible stories and attention to detail and due to duncan jones', albeit small, prior efforts at directing movies. this movie is truly unlike you've ever seen before! seeing a grand adventure world like this come sprawling to life being made mostly with cgi and motion capture is utterly amazing. i know, i know.. too much cgi is never a good thing, and i'm usually in that camp too, but put these orcs in lord of the rings costumes and makeup then duncan jones would never have been able to capture the essence of their 'humanity', the feelings wouldn't show and alas they would be nothing but unrelatable scary monsters. the point of this film is to do exactly the opposite. duncan and the actors behind the motion capture manage to hit the nail on this one! the story is great, grand and adventures. it feels like a proper fantasy through and through, epic in scale and enormous in stakes. one can't help but end up rooting for both sides of this conflict. magic is everything in a fantasy, and finally getting to see what a true wielder of the arcane arts is capable of is like a nerd wet dream come true. gosh how i love the magic and the sheer scale of it in this movie is incredible. it is finally so good to see it done on a large and forceful scale in a movie! i didn't stop smiling once during this movie, utterly entertaining and amazing eye candy. the movie isn't pure goodness though - warcraft is filled to the brink with characters, some are properly introduced some aren't, some with motivations which aren't fully explained and the lack thereof can make one a confused. the amount of characters being balanced in this movie are a bit too many, but then again, trying to please an already established and demanding fan base can't be anything but tricky. the specifics of the lore are impossible to learn through the movie, so be ready to do some digging once you've seen it. it is action packed! both for the better and worse. there are few times where this movie really slows down and lets you wallow in this beautiful and realized world, which is a shame. it can really take your breath away be it by exhaustion or the vistas. i

what was coming. i told myself before watching it that i would go in with a clear mind and just enjoy it as a new fantasy movie. which i tried, but ... yeah. well anyway. as a fan i came out of it with very mixed feelings. i already knew from duncan that certain things had changed, so that didn't surprise me. but what surprised me was the actual changes. one thing for sure: if you are a lore freak, you will probably dislike these changes a lot. however. i do think that these changes were needed to make the original story into a movie. some changes were required to make the viewer feel this and that. let me move on about all of that now. i got so many things to say, but to keep it short, here is a list of flaws i felt during the movie: the movie is too short. this leads into the next point which is... its length meant that certain characters i would loved more of, didn't get enough screen time. they cut a lot of scenes which we had previously seen in trailers and such. which

the movie starts and ends with durotan' narration; the first close up of any character we see was durotan. this may be irksome to some, because it does not follow the classic formula of the orcs being one dimensional bad guys, and the humans being the heroes. the orcs portrayed here have language, culture, emotions, honor and morals. warcraft tries boldly to bring something new to the table here, and like most new things in art, it will get pounded down to the ground before it is accepted. which is a shame really. a lot of people have already praised the movie for its art, cinematography, cgi, and action sequences so i won't go into them in detail again. i took 1 star off because the editing made the movie very fast paced. for a person like me who was not familiar with warcraft lore some of the details was hard to follow on the first viewing. i heard the producer cut off 40 minutes of footage so hopefully we will get a director's cut and see the movie in its entirety. i took off another

locations in the game are faithfully reproduced so that they are instantly recognisable in the movie. costumes, buildings, even the way magic is portrayed looks very much like in the games. this is very much a film for fans of the game. as a standalone movie it also works well. though of course many of the game's references will be lost on viewers not familiar with the game, it still works as a solid action film. my one complaint is that in some parts of the film, especially early on, things felt a little rushed. i found myself on more than one occasion wondering if there were some deleted scenes there since some parts seemed a little disjointed. i'm no expert on film editing but the pacing just seemed a little off. over-all, i found it a fun film. great effects, great action and a real treat for fans of the game. good enough perhaps, to make up for how disappointing the game itself has become in recent years.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft: the beginning': four stars (out of five) fantasy-action flick; based on the immensely popular video game franchise, and novel series (of the same name). this movie tells the origin story, of how an army of orcs invaded the world of azeroth; to take it for their own. it was directed by duncan jones (who also helmed such other popular sci-fi flicks, as 'moon' and 'source code'); it was also written by jones and charles leavitt (based on a story, and characters, created by chris metzen). the film stars travis fimmel, paula patton, toby kebbell, ben foster, dominic cooper, daniel wu and ben schnetzer. it's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely profitable blockbuster overseas (breaking many records, all around the world). i really wanted to like this movie, and i did love it's visuals, but the story and characters are a little disappointing. the film tells the story of a world of orcs, called draenor, that's quickly dying. they've discovered a portal, using a powerful magic force called the fel, that will lead them to another world (known as azeroth). the army of orcs, known as the horde, is lead by a sinister orc, named gul'dan (wu); who uses the fel to drain the life force of other species (in order to fuel the portal). one noble orc chieftan, named durotan (kebbell), doesn't want to enslave the people of azeroth (for this purpose). so durotan, and a half-breed (orc-human) named garona (patton), attempt to form an alliance with the humans there. the humans are lead by a king, named llane (cooper), and a knight, named lothar (fimmel). i've never played the game, or read any of the books (or comics), so i didn't have any real high expectations for this movie. i did love the trailer though, because of it's visuals; and i have to say, the special effects (in this movie) are some of the best i've ever seen. i also love epic sc-fi fantasy flicks, like this. i'm just disappointed that the story, and characters, don't live up to the film's spectacular visuals. duncan jones is a very talented director; but his wife did get cancer during the production of this movie (and his father, david bowie, died of it). still, i think he delivered. i think the movie's main problems are due to it's script (which jones did help write though). i think it was probably too faithful to the video game series, and novels. the story might have worked really well in those formats, but translating it to other art forms (like film) doesn't always work. i hope the sequels are much better (i did absolutely love this movie's visuals though). i probably would have liked the film much more, when i was a kid. watch our movie review show 'movie talk' at: URL", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "let me just put this out there right now: i have never played warcraft. my experience with warcraft is limited to one of my friends from school being hospitalized because he survived solely on dr. pepper for a week while playing the darn thing. i say this because many within a certain community will see any criticism towards this film suspect; even more so coming from someone from the outside looking in. all that said, warcraft the movie is not that bad. the story begins with a horde of orcs invading the realm of azeroth with chieftain durotan (kebbell) and his mate draka (galvin) among the first wave. their leader gul'dan (wu) uses a ethereal form of black magic known as the fel that requires mortal sacrifice, which many of the orc clans look on with suspicion. meanwhile lothar (fimmel), military commander of the human kingdom, and a mage named khadgar (schnetzer) find out about the fel and bring news to king wrynn and medivh (foster) the guardian of the realm. they investigate further and capture scrappy half-orc survivor garona (patton) who agrees to help the humans and try to incite a rebellion along with durotan from within. draenor, stormwind, azeroth, karazhan, mak'gora, dalaran; if these words mean something to you then guess what, you can probably pay attention to the plot with relative ease. those of you who did not do the homework however will have to sit in the corner and feel the acrid pangs of being ostracized; like naively showing up to a party you're not invited to. it's even all the more punishing when characters speak in paragraphs of exposition and explanations. we get all the trappings of a fantasy adventure including palace intrigue, otherworldly artifices, fantastical creatures and sword- to-flesh chest pounding, yet the narrative fails to give us much reason to care. that's a pretty large feat considering the amount of death that surrounds gul'dan and his horde. so why then do i say warcraft is not that bad? well for one, duncan jones's visual cleverness and attention to detail is still present, despite the film's need to frustratingly skip any honest-to-goodness emotion or characterization. jones is not of the mtv generation of action filmmakers who use shaky cam, fast editing and dynamic camera angles to slam their audiences against the wall. instead jones litters his action with a fast processional of setups and payoffs broken up by tracking shots of people hurdling towards each other. that along with an affinity for epic wide shots of battlefields prove he may be among the forefront of a new generation of directors who take their inspiration from video-games. there's no value judgment here on whether lifting ideas from video- games is a good idea though it is refreshing to see a director take a different tact. the visual grammar is primordial and a little clunky at times but when it works, it really works. warcraft could have ended up like the much maligned dungeons and dragons (2000). as it stands warcraft is more of a bargain bin lord of the rings (2001- 2003) providing some interesting visual thrills though using bland characters that might as well be made of clay. in summation, warcraft is kind of like the dungeons and dragons starter set. the one where you first create your character class, roll for ability scores, determine statistics and alignment while forming a solid backstory. it's a whole lot of setup and ironically very little actual war-craft but at least it leaves you with a lot to work with. oh, you have no idea what i'm talking about? do those last few sentences make little sense? well then, you know how i feel.", "class":

was very enjoyable and entertaining. fantasy genre that was missing for awhile. watch it and judge for yourself.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "just finished watching the movie. as a major fan of the warcraft universe and a big blizzard fanboy, here is my wall of text: i have to applaud the attempt at bringing this movie to life. similar to civil war having a ton of characters, the insanely detailed and rich lore of warcraft is incredibly hard to fit into a 2 hour screen time. however, unlike civil war, warcraft isn't that well glued together and suffers from many things a lot of critics have mentioned. nevertheless, i think the movie has received an unfair amount of bashing and is definitely a good video game movie which follows the source material closely. i'll start of by saying that the cgi and the motion capture is amazing. every single orc looks unique, moves and fights appropriately for their size and is menacing just like they are supposed to be. lord of the rings orcs are a joke compared to these bad boys. the true orc stars are of course durotan (the wise, young frostwolf clan chieftain) and gul'dan (the sinister, demonic warlock), who each shine in their own way. durotan is probably the best developed character in the movie and his facial expressions are jaw dropping. gul'dan is evil incarnate. the way he sucks the souls out of his victims is flat out terrifying. the magic in this movie is of the hook, balls to the wall, full throttle powerful. it is spectacular and a breath of fresh air compared to the lackluster, weaksauce magic you get in harry potter and other movies. the sorcery action clearly establishes that mages are by far the most dangerous and lethal people (and orcs) to walk azeroth. i was afraid i was going to hate khadgar when i saw the trailers, but surprisingly he ends up being rather compelling. the human armor is interesting, colorful and exactly what you would expect from a human army in this universe. while the armor is beautiful and shiny, some people wearing it aren't colorful enough personalities to make it work. the king, played by dominic cooper, is dull, uninspiring and is unreasonably friendly and naive (just like his queen) when it comes to the interaction with the orcs. to me it felt unrealistic that both would be so open and friendly with garona. a lack of prejudice on the human side made that side of the conflict seem too mellow, pacifist and boring in some cases. it is clear that a lot of hatred of the orcs was cut out of the movie (there is 30-40 minutes more available in the directors cut) since it was present in the trailers. this is a shame, since racial prejudice has always been a big part of the warcraft lore. that makes the team up moments much more sweet when they actually happen. other characters, specifically medivh, garona and lothar are reasonable, but lack anything particularly interesting about them. they work for the movie but the performances could have been better. specifically lothar didn't get enough time to develop his relationship with his family. everyone could have used a couple more minutes to give them more spice. the pacing in the movie, as mentioned before by many other reviewers, is bad. there is a bit too much jumping around from point a to point b, making each individual scene have less of an impact. as a result, the movie is not grounded enough to have proper world building, which in my opinion was what made the first lotr movie so good. as such, a lot of mystery and wonder is lost because the movie doesn't leave the audience enough time to process what have happened. the movie has a lot of magic, but the magic of subtlety is not one of them. while flawed in many ways, i think this a decent first attempt by blizzard to get into the movie business. what is great about warcraft is that it doesn't follow a lot of terrible and boring hollywood clich\u00e9s. the orcs are much more than just useless idiots, as they are an actual people with feelings and code of honor. the movie is bold with its plot (thanks to the story being bold) and these risks taken make it much more enjoyable. the fact that marvel is playing it too safe with their characters is one of my greatest pet peeves. warcraft has stunning visuals and a couple of very great and touching moments, but suffers from a story that is too rapid fire. 7/10 for me (and 7/10 for non fans also, if anything me knowing the story makes me more critical). hopefully this movie gets the money and we get a sequel. the potential is there to get a great one.", "class":

warcraft to do the same. i also look forward to seeing the extended edition, for it can only get better.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "first and foremost, i'd like to thank the critics (rotten tomatoes) for helping me determine whether to see the movie. i know that they have terrible taste in movies so if they give it a low rating then i can count on it being a good movie since movies tend to turn out opposite of what they rate it. next, i'm going to list the pros and cons for this movie so the average movie goer can get a more accurate depiction of the movie. for the average movie goer, the cgi tends to stand out the most among the experience. even the magic, which can easily be boring such as the harry potter movie with the scene involving the duel between voldemort and harry, was up to par. the magic looked impressive as it should be. the fight scenes were well choreographed so if you're an action junkie and love a good fight scene, then this will not disappoint. warcraft lore is packed with so much information that it isn't feasible to get a non-fan up to speed in just one movie. the movie's story line is more of a summary of the events that transpired within the world of warcraft. all of the main characters have significant back stories and so do the locales. for example, khadgar travels to dalaran but the significance of that place has not been explained. therefore, only the fan base knows why it is flying in the air or why khadgar travelled there in the first place. the non-fan would only come to the conclusion that powerful mages reside there. the relationships were not explained in detail either. orgrim and durotan are best friends and when orgrim betrays durotan, a lot of the inner turmoil orgrim faced before making that decision had been left out. he just \"happened to do it\". if you are a fan, you will love this movie. i spent the entire time examining the architecture and looking for details that correlate to the game. a lot of us raided karazhan in bc so it was cool to see how much of it looked like the movie version. even moroes, who was a raid boss in karazhan, had been featured in the movie, along with his death. stormwind and ironforge were wonderfully crafted and look like the in-game version. practically, every visual detail had been pushed to perfection, in regards to precision. then, you have a bunch of characters who were not introduced but as an avid player, would be able to recognize. among them, grommash hellscream and kargath bladefist are shown on screen and easily recognizable. the characters look like their in-game counter parts and that was impressive. as a fan, my complaints are as follows; does a mediocre (at best) job at drawing in non-fans, cheesy/clich\u00e9 dialogue which makes the characters harder to relate to since they don't display normal personality characteristics, and a weak lead in to a sequel. tl;dr version good cgi and fight scenes to make it a visually impressive spectacle for fans and non-fans alike. underdeveloped story line leaving non- fans confused about each character's plight and motives. to be fair though, the warcraft universe has so much story in it that it would be hard to fill in an uninformed audience in such a short amount of time. literally, to capture all the backstory leading up to the events in the movie would take up an entire movie slot on its own. ultimately, a non-fan would have a general idea of what's going on but would not be able to appreciate the accuracy of architecture and character models since this would be their first time experiencing these elements.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "so i played warcraft ii and iii as a kid. i put 6+ years into the world of warcraft. i am a fan. that being said, i found this movie

bit slow. they do do a good job of developing the characters. by the final quarter of the film you are invested and care about these people. and boy that final quarter really is strong. the movie ends very well, with a lot of action and denouement, and then a lot of setups for sequels. and i left the theatre wanting to see those sequels. there is a lot of fan service here, and most of it is very smartly done. overall, as a fan of the franchise, i was pleased with the film. it wasn't spectacular, but it is a good start for what are hopefully going to be more movies.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "duncan jones made a name for himself as a director of highly intelligent science-fiction movies with a fair dose of humanism, so he sounded like an ideal guy to deliver a game adaptation that would stand out as really good for a change. choosing warcraft was risky, however, since it has become a multi-game franchise over the decades, one with its own complex story lines, characters and mythology. distilling a story thread out of a game's lore that is cinematically satisfying while still doing justice to the gaming experience is a trap that many a director has fallen into. so the question is: did jones succeed? my answer is: yes and no. although i have played my share of warcraft, i am no hardcore fan or connaisseur (i sort of lost interest halfway through wciii: frozen throne), but i cannot deny that jones delivered a pretty convincing visual representation of how i remember the warcraft universe. the cities and castles look impressive and lush; the orcs look physically imposing, realistic and dangerous, but they never become mindless beasts; and the colorful human armors and weapons are instantly recognizable from the games. the battle scenes look impressive and brutal, without going into much gory and appendage-shedding details (since teens should also be able to enjoy this). the cgi, often the scapegoat that disappointed audiences aim for, looks almost flawless here, and convincingly helps to create this universe. it was a prudent move of jones to cast mainly caucasian actors as the orcs, because many directors before him had to battle allegations of racism for having a tribal people played by non-white actors. both humans, orcs and half-breeds are portrayed by a diverse mix of ethnicities now, which works fine. but did jones really need to be in such a rush to get the story told? i haven't kept a score, but the first 15 minutes introduces about 5 different locations, 10 characters and maybe 7 unique terms. it is as if the entire first act contains more information than both 'moon' and 'source code' combined. i love a bit of fast pacing, but here i got exhausted to keep up with this frenetic storytelling. jones' scripts are usually pretty well- written, but here it is easily the source of most of the movie's shortcomings, or maybe it is in the editing. i had the distinct feeling that this was originally a 3-hour movie that had to be cut back to 2 hours on studio demand. many characters are thrown in with little to no introduction (it's usually not a good sign if you have to learn character names from the end credits); some of the peoples (elves and dwarfs mainly) are merely referenced, so you never get a sense that azaroth is such a diversely populated world; and some sequences evoke the feeling that a lot of exposition is missing (even some of the action scenes lack coherence). that makes it difficult to get absorbed into the story, or care for the characters, despite some nice, unexpected twists at the end, which would have worked much more satisfyingly had we known the characters better. maybe i am spoiled by game of thrones, where i get to know and love the characters over the course of many hours, and feel genuine heartache when they get killed off, but jones should really have put more effort in building a solid foundation with a backstory and the characters. so, a nice visual attempt to make a faithful game adaptation, but again, the difficulty of translating game to screen is showing. i had a good time with it, but as the subtitle says: it is a beginning, and hopefully a good starting point for a better fleshed-out sequel.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft is a movie based on video game made by blizzard. it is one of the most popular game in this generation.

what did most of the reviews see this movies as a failure in fact for me this comes definitely as one of the best movies of 2016. for every warcraft fan this movie is a well deserved reward. something that moves the game outside the gamers corner to the \"public\" which i think is not ready for the amazing universe warcraft has in it's pocket ready to blow your mind. the only thing i see as a negative is the length of the movie which is !only\" 2 hours. i could have watched it for at least 3-4 :)) i hope this movie get's a sequel because i don't want to watch the same movie all over again

expectations simply because of how badly it was getting bashed by the critics. like, have you read some of those reviews? geez, do critics hate this film. when the credits rolled my friend (who has never played warcraft and knew nothing about the lore) and i turned to each other with wonder and asked \"did we see the same film as them??\" the beginning scene was jaw-dropping, especially for a warcraft fan, and from the beginning the film was amazingly immersive. the first shot of the main orc blew me away - you could really see emotion in his eyes. the critics should be ashamed of themselves for claiming the acting in this movie is poor. somehow the huge cast managed to make me totally believe in the high fantasy storyline and it felt like there was actually something at stake. my friend, who had never heard of the characters before, actually teared up twice. the one problem with this movie is there's a lot of name-dropping, which is fine if you've played wow before, but it took a while for my friend to differentiate between a few people. medivh and khadgar were amazing. the mages and magic in this film are just so well done. anyway, if you like fantasy or action films, i highly recommend watching this, even if you don't know the lore. go in with an open mind and it will definitely exceed your expectations. the visuals and acting are brilliant, and it manages to stay true to the aesthetic of the game without looking tacky or garish. the only design i did not like was the look of the elves, and i hope they refine them a little in the sequel (if there is one, and i really hope there is!) best fantasy film so far this year... don't let the critics change your mind! they are ridiculously wrong. go see it!", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "no, i've never played the video game world of warcraft, but i've seen the $161-million dollar, pg-13 rated, universal pictures' extravaganza. what \"source code\" director duncan jones, \"seventh son\" scenarist charles leavitt, and \"warcraft ii & iii\" video game scribe chris metzen have wrought is a larger-than-life, adventure fantasy inspired by j.r.r. tolkien's classic \"lord of the rings\" and c.s. lewis' \"narnia\" novels. this sprawling sword & sorcery saga pits terrestrial humans against marauding extraterrestrial orcs in a cornucopia of striking computer generated images. if you've seen either the trailers or publicity photos for \"warcraft,\" you know those intimidating orcs resemble goliath-like humanoids, possess massive limbs, and have a frank frazetta look. tusks bulge improbably from their grim mouths as if they were colossal warthogs. indeed, these belligerent invaders emerge as mighty gruesome. they wield humongous hammers that would make thor crap in his drawers, and they abide by a staunch code of honor. namely, orcs don't fib. once they promise something, they adhere to their word. of course, the orcs are avatars that unseen but seasoned thespians such as toby kebbell, rob kazinsky, and clancy brown portray in motion capture outfits. meantime, the humans resemble arthurian knights adorned in elaborate suits of armor with massive glittering swords. whereas the orcs gallivant around on gigantic wolves, the humans cruise the skies astraddle giant griffins when they aren't riding horses. aside from travis fimmel's sympathetic protagonist anduin lothar and dominic cooper's noble king llane wrynn, \"warcraft\" relies largely on hundreds of cgi characters. what these characters lack in depth, jones and his special effects wizards compensate for with ghoulish countenances. the filmmakers are not interested in diplomacy as much as they are fascinated with the pugnacious warriors and warlords as they engage in a battle to the death for a little over two hours. this above-average, cinematic adaptation isn't as abhorrent as many critics have claimed, and the narrative ambiguities in \"warcraft\" actually provide it with some surprising depth. neither orcs nor humans are entirely either evil or heroic. \"warcraft\" chronicles a merciless clash between two vastly different races of warriors. first, director duncan jones and his scribes introduce us to the mighty orcs. hailing from a dying planet named draenor, they set out to conquer the planet azeroth where king llane wrynn (dominic cooper of \"need for speed\") of stormwind presides over a human population living in comparative peace. those rugged, mesomorphic orcs march to the orders of a wicked warlock, gul'dan (voiced by daniel wu of \"europa report\"), who resembles the spawn of satan with an elaborate thicket of antlers bristling from his back. gul'dan mobilizes the orc tribes into an army called the horde, and he conjures up a colossal trans-dimensional portal. the orc shaman practices a noxious form of black magic called the fel. he deploys the fel to make the portal operational. the portal derives its power from the life force of captives that the orcs have imprisoned and transported to azeroth. this mysterious fel depletes life energy of those prisoners and their life energy maintains the portal. this portal is reminiscent of the gateways in the vintage sci-fi film \"stargate\" and the television series it spun off that transported individuals from one world to another. the murky green fel is so toxic that it corrupts anybody and anything, and this malignant force has warped gul'dan so dreadfully that some of his own kind have come to abhor it. the orc warrior durotan (voice of toby kebbell of \"fantastic four\") rules the frostwolf clan. as one of the many draenor tribes, the frostwolf clan has joined gul'dan's horde. durotan wants his people, particularly his pregnant wife draka (voice of anna galvin), to thrive as prosperously as they once did before their planet began to deteriorate. durotan's clan takes its name from the enormous wolves that they ride. meantime, durotan doesn't completely trust gul'dan or the terrible green fel magic that destroys everything it touches. this generates considerable friction between durotan and war chieftain blackhand (voiced by clancy brown of \"highlander\"), especially after the latter discovers that the former is plotting treason behind his back. durotan calls a truce and has words with king wynn, but blackhand surprises the two and attacks them. during this wild melee, stormwind's sorcerer medivh, (ben foster of \"the mechanic\") the legendary guardian of tirisfal, saves king wynn's life by deploying a shield to thwart blackhand's warriors from slaying him. unfortunately, king wynn's army commander sir anduin lothar (travis fimmel of \"vikings\") loses his son, when the young warrior is caught on the wrong side. not only does lothar suspect that the fel has corrupted medivh, but he also believes that medivh and gul'dan may have been conspiring with each other. anybody who isn't thoroughly acquainted with the mythology of warcraft may find themselves bewildered by the byzantine stratums of the story. painstaking research enabled me to clear up who was who in the complex line-up of characters. indeed, i talked with a seasoned \"warcraft\" gamer who has been playing the blizzard entertainment game for over a decade. i watched \"warcraft\" twice before i gained a clear understanding of the hierarchies for both the horde and stormwind alliance. if you've never played warcraft, the best way to enjoy \"warcraft\" the movie is to savor it simply for both its breathtaking computer generated imagery and interesting combatants. the grotesque orcs are extremely ugly, while the stormwind warriors reminded me of king arthur's knights from the classic movie \"excalibur.\" \"blood diamond\" scenarist charles leavitt and \"warcraft\" game author chris metzen gloss over some salient points in the warcraft universe. miraculously, director duncan jones doesn't let the plethora of exposition take the edge off the savage, testosterone-laden action. he plunges audiences into the stunning cgi imagery with its adrenaline-laced action sequences without drenching us in gallons of blood and gore to compensate for the plot. \"warcraft\" lives up to its title

showed. and the visual effects are stunning. they felt very fantastical but rarely ever to the point i felt like it was just cgi. this is especially true with film's orcs. unlike the hobbit, the mo-capped orcs are brought to full realization. despite their ridiculous proportions, the orcs feel real from seeing the bulging in their massive muscles, the hair and sweat on their skin to the expression of their faces. the characters i thought for the most part were pretty likable. toby kebbel once again proves that he is becoming a star with mo-cap as he is the best part of the movie as the orc chief durotan. every scene he is in you see that he has so many strong human qualities despite being a 7-foot bulky orc from being a wise leader and warrior to a man that shows a strong love for his people and family. paula patton actually did a better job then i was expecting by acting as the medium between the horde and the alliance. travis fimmel does a fine job as lothar by coming off as a bad-ass though there were times i felt he was a bit too unlikeable. dominic cooper and ruth negga (both you can see on preacher) did good despite being limited by the screenplay. ben foster and ben shnetzer still felt like a weird choices to play the two main wizards. the battle sequence between the orcs and humans feel very but at the same time pretty violent despite the movie being so colourful and having a pg-13 rating. the introduction to the orcs is probably one of the best openings ever. the same can't be said for when we are introduced to the human characters. this is when problems of film become visible. the intro to lothar and all the other human characters feels nothing but forced exposition that lasts for the first quarter of the movie. as critics have pointed out, it does feel like large portions of this movie are missing similar to batman v superman. footage of seeing lothar being with his son and durotan having more conversations with his friend orgrim would help immensely with a lot of the character motivations. the director duncan jones has created a big and beautiful film that i feel is greatly hurt by the studio cutting out important character scenes just to have a shorter run time. in terms of duncan jone's past movies he has made, warcraft is not the best (the best still is moon) but i applaud him for creating this movie with such thought and

direction and the script must really breathe some fresh air into already stale \"sword and sorcery\" genre. principal shooting reportedly took four months and post-production took additional twenty.

render-farms. the cinematography (or whatever filters they've used in the post) is vividly colorful, luscious and glamorous as one should expect from a fantasy film. the costume design, the props and the sets are done impeccably and to a tremendous detail. the script is unexpectedly self-conscious. although it pits humans into battle against yet another monster species, we're allowed to observe both sides on equal footing. both factions have their motives, their good and bad guys - we learn what's at stake for all of them. not only it makes harder for the audience to pick sides, it makes for a more thrilling viewing as well. still, despite all these things going for \"warcraft\", it's still the direction that sits at the heart of it all. it plays to the strength of the script, it's

go through all the familiar tropes of the genre as if they were anew. because \"warcraft\" could give lessons to some better known franchises of this and other genres. it could, for one, teach \"lord

blizzard entertainments(he creator-company behind the warcraft universe) games and i have also sunk hours upon hours into the lore of warcraft. and as both a gamer and a warcraft lore nerd i think this is so far one of the few(if not the only) movies, based on a video-game franchise, that can hold up to the franchise it's representing. and with that being such a rare thing this movie deserves the biggest praise. with that said though, as a movie, it has obvious flaws. but also moments that are excellent. there is some parts that you just can see where blizzard have had their hand in making things that are as true to what makes their video games on a unparalleled scale. and that is the \"cgi\". the orcs and their home-world looks amazing and you cannot help but to feel strongly for the animated characters in many different ways just because of how they look, move, act and talk. it's truly, yet again, a masterpiece of art created by blizzard. they really feel like they have a soul unlike many other animated movies and cut-scenes created now a days. with that said though. if i had not read and invested so much time beforehand and already knew these characters and where they came from i most likely would be very confused as to what was going on on the screen. especially the first parts that throw you from scene to scene and character to character making it very hard to follow and get emotionally invested as to what's being shown. and even though that is not as big of an issue in the rest of the movie it's still there and it made made it hard to be able to connect to the characters as i wanted to and many of the witty and emotional scenes that could have been great fell short because of it. and when the \"cgi\" parts still won my heart due to how excellently made they are. the parts with real life actors made me cringe most of the time and also the choice of actors felt off. it made the movie at parts more feel like a mediocre sci-fi/fantasy tv show than a big movie production. i so wanted it work but i knew it was going to be hard for me even before i went into the movie-theater as i have never been a fan of the mix of animated characters and real actors. and when the non-animated parts feel closer to a low budget production than a high budget one it throws me off even more. now i could have been fine with all of the non-animated parts flaws if they had taken the time to develop all the characters and the story. i very much want to make a parallel to lord of the rings since if they had followed a similar model to lotr and made the movie 30-60min longer and worked the scenes(specially the parts in the beginning) in a way as to not make it feel as rushed, not only would the choice of actors have felt as weak but many of the scenes in the movie would have hit closer to home than it does in its current shape. one could hope that there is a directors cut or something similar to get your hands on in the future, if so, wait for that. it would be worth it. but with that said, for this to be one of the few(or the first) true movie based on a video-game world that stays true to the world at hand it does get a big plus, as well as for the animated parts. as a video-game fan or a warcraft fan this movie is a yes. as someone who does not have any prior knowledge or interaction of the warcraft world, i don't see how this movie would be anything for you. but if you like amazing animations. go for it. but you most likely will not leave this movie behind you with your emotions swayed in any way even though many scenes try to get you

that anyone who likes the fantasy genre will like this. you do not need to be a fan of the game or even have ever played the game to enjoy this. someone who is familiar with the game will obviously 'get' the easter eggs and homage to the game, and it is awesome that blizzard put those items in there (a 'nod' to the many fans of the game). blizzard/legendary did a wonderful job of making a major

the future. can't wait for the sequels.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i only played \"warcraft iii\". thoroughly enjoyed it, i used to load it up every day i returned from school. so, that being said, i ain't much of an expert on this world nor i am some huge fan. no. though, i happen to be a film fan and i simply enjoy good filmmaking. with warcraft, this is the case. outsdandingly good film-craft. there is everything in the fantasy flick needs to be - stunning visuals, interesting and relatable characters, solid story and tons of actual magic. story pacing is just fine, there is not much of a character development though, but hey, that's because mostly all of the main heroes and villains are already established, and that is perfectly fine with me. neved did i feel bored or underwhelmed. i personally didn't have any problems following the plot and understanding all the reasons within the film itself. a subject on its own is the soundtrack. i divide the ost into 2 groups - the ones i hear in a film and right after the screening almost instantly forget, and then, there are those special which you never forget. and in warcraft there is an amazingly brilliant soundtrack. actors are great. they really sunk into their respective roles. my favorites are lothar and surprisingly gul'dan - his voice-acting and overall appearance were mind-blowing. a perfect villain for the film that is establishing the cinematic universe. summarizing, i have a feeling that this film is the case of bvs which launched earlier this year - critics buried it instantly, while fans and average moviegoers wholeheartedly enjoyed and accepted it. i am just so glad that there is going to be a sequel for this excellent fantasy flick and that it is successful in the international box-office. do yourself a service - forget the critics' \"valuable and knowledgeable\" opinions and go give this film a chance. you live only once to let someone else's opinion influence your own view on the matter - do no be a sheep. i give this film a 10/10 not because it was flawless (cause it was flawed), not because it is a masterpiece (which it isn't, none of the existing films are, actually), but because it simply made my life a little bit better and more meaningful. and that, i can say about only a few films out of those thousands and thousand i've ever seen. be buying this on blu-ray and keep re-

is different, and two, that i can see this movie booming to the level that disney has done with star wars and the avengers series, not only for its already loyal following of fans around the world, but also for its story telling. the movie had good character development, and told me enough about the characters to understand the already established warcraft universe. the actors were on point, the story was simple, while original, and the relationships were genuine (nothing felt forced). the ending was strong, and really set it up for a series of sequels to follow. the graphics were out of this

tale which offered up similar emotions to those shared by other great films of our generation. this is first, and foremost a movie whose intent was mass entertainment! blizzard wants to provide something that anyone can sit through and enjoy. only then, as a bonus is there the story of a video game for us geeks. with that being said, the story is solid and easy for anyone to follow. the action scenes (despite there being no blood) were positively outstanding. it will not occur to the viewer until afterwards that there had been no simulated blood! don't miss out on a groundbreaking effort by blizzard to create a solid piece which provides us an opportunity to come together as two historically opposite populations united (that is the nerds and \"non-techies\") ...or was it the

the audience differs big time. this movie claims to be a fantasy movie telling an epic story and it is exactly what it does. and it does it in a very good way. the lore of warcraft is a very rich one with several games and novels. they are tons of important characters and events which build the background to the story. even if this is the beginning of it, its not an easy task to compress such a huge background into a time frame of two hours and make a movie which satisfy the warcraft fans and the people who have no idea about this fantasy universe. you cant satisfy everybody equally. many fans simply missing their favorite aspects of the lore and newcomers are already overwhelmed with so many unknown places, characters and background. but this movie did a fairly decent job to find a middle ground. many critics say you cant build up an emotional releations to the characters which i think depends on the point of view. if you have no idea about azeroth and concentrate the first time you see this movie on all those strange places, characters then yes maybe you get overwhelmed. but if you focus on the basic principles which are survival, friendship, thrust, family, love and making the right decision than you can immerse very easy in the world of azeroth. this is not a socialdrama, a romcom or a society critic. this is a movie that let you dive in to a wonderful fantasy universe and entertains you. its kind of a escapist movie which isn't a bad thing. i am glad that the audience that has seen this film likes it overall (around 80% likes on every major movie side.) so make up

are allowed to give their reviews, when they were so far off course (not all, as some had valid points, but still very shallow reasoning for them). before i start on the review, a little history so you understand where i am coming from... if you want to go straight to my thoughts on the movie, skip down to \"review!\" my introduction to warcraft was when i was 5 years old. parents were out for some reason i can't remember anymore, and i was going through my dads cd's to find a game play on the computer. i found a copied disk with the name \"warcraft ii.\" bam! my first game i ever played that was some sort of fun action and not educational or some sort of puzzle game (memphis math, wallaby jack, jump start, read with me, etc.). i would take the scrap computer parts my dad had lying around (they were more actually organized into bins by categories) in attempts to put together as many machines as i could to get my friends to play with me. my dad taught it at a junior college during this time, and he would let me bring my friends on nights he was grading paper work to play networked. sometimes his students would come in and play with us as well. we played other games too; like starcraft, doom, quake, but warcraft ii was the one game we all loved to play the most. building these machines and learning how to troubleshoot and configure networking settings like adding ipx as a protocol was where my love of technology started, and got me into my career working in it. a couple of years later, i was so excited about windows 98 and a windows desktop option called something like \"live wallpaper.\" i downloaded the gif's from the website during development of warcraft iii because i was so excited for the next game in the warcraft series. then world of warcraft was announced. the idea of having a hero inside this world was mind blowing. long story short, it helped me through a time when i chose to remove the negative influences in my life for the better. then i got married, was made fun of by my new wife, made her try it until she actually started to love it and became better than me at some classes. i now have 4 kids and still working my tail off, so i do not have the luxury to enjoy it anymore. regardless, this game has a lot of meaning to me in how many wonderful memories i have from my past. every since i was five years old, i have dreamed of this world coming to life on film. i can now say that one of my childhood dreams have come true. now, you understand how much this movie finally coming to fruition means to me and what my expectations would be for such a tremendous influence through my life... review we all know how well games coming to film has worked out over the years. not so good in general. so, i went into this, hoping and praying that it would be good, but expecting some half-$% cgi work and terribly fake magic. the trailers showed a bit, but not enough to really tell how well they did the orcs or how well magic looked overall. i can say that i was blown away, compared to what i was expecting! the orcs looked phenomenal! the fight scenes were awesome. sometimes they felt like they were moving a bit slow and they were flashing through scenes too quickly to fully enjoy the combat, but i loved it still. they have some especially awesome action stunts here and there! magic was terrific! there was one part that it was a little \"eh,\" but i was able to let it go. the rest of it looked fantastic! considering what they could have done to change the lore and story, they did a wonderful job keeping mostly to it. there are a few details that those who have read through the books will be able to point out, but those details i was also able to get over (they were not huge changes to the overall story). there was one change i actually liked better. there was also one change that i still am not so sure about, concerning a certain orc, but the main points were hit. i loved how they put in little details here and there to emphasize a certain title, name, location, etc. (trying not to give spoilers) without having to go into too much detail to explain. it is no where near as bad as the \"real critics\" seem to think it is in the storytelling. the acting was great. i was especially impressed with how they were able to effectively portray the personalities of khadgar, medivh, and durotan. garona and lothar were two that i was not entirely impressed with, but they didn't do a bad acting job by any means. i just did not really connect with the two as i felt i should have (lothar at least). they really showed the true side of traditional orcs in here as well, which was a big one for me. if you are not a fan of warcraft, but enjoy fantasy and action movies, you should not be disappointed! (some people still have different opinions, no matter how much i think any stated above would love it) fans - i suggest you keep your eyes out for particular personages and details throughout ;).

show. warcraft is the second movie in my life that i watched 2 times in a row, the first one being avatar. i am a huge fan of avatar, mostly because i am considering it to be much more than a movie, but a real experience. same thing i felt with warcraft. both are a real spectacle where you become part of a fantasy that feels so real that you don t even question what is happening there, because... it is real. you don't question something that is real, you just accept it. because reality is different than movies, reality can be cruel, unjust and so many times not according to your plan. i also enjoyed a lot lotr series, but warcraft and avatar are something different. lotr is a pleasing movie, easy plots, very good guys vs very bad guys and with the good guys having happy endings. this, plus the great visuals and good casting made it a movie for everyone. warcraft has war in title, so expect to see a movie about war. it is not a \"feel good\" movie. it is a not a movie with happy endings, it s a very sad war story where heroism and sacrifice are not rewarded accordingly. it is also a movie where bad and good are relative. it feels more like a reality show from a war zone. the characters are what they are, with flaws and weaknesses, driven by simple motivations like survival or protecting their family and friends. the relation between them are honest and simple. the movie is not trying to make you love them, the movie just tells their story in a very difficult moment of their existence. you can sense their fear and there is a permanent tension in the movie that in my opinion is the reason why some may dislike it. the movie does not have those feel good moments where tension is released, instead the tension builds up until the last part of the movie where the dramatic charge is overwhelming. if you add the tragic and dramatic fate of the characters i can see why the movie was not been appreciated by some folks who expected an easy going movie with handsome elves and good wizards defeating the bad orcs and the bad wizards. go see warcraft with open mind and enjoy this amazing experience. it is an unique movie, a real work of art that deserves some

interesting and likable characters (i loved medivh, the king's brother was also very well portrayed). and i will stop here with the additions, because i do feel there were a few points where the movie fell short of being a true masterpiece, such as the scenes where it wanted to convey emotion but failed miserably (at least for me) or the (at times) lackluster battle scenes between humans and orcs where at certain points it looked like they weren't even trying, but the movie doesn't rely on that fortunately. from my perspective, this was better than the hobbit series and almost as good as lord

make is to simply describe the pacing in game of thrones. i think that one of the more significant reasons why something like game of thrones is so explosively successful is the fact that they more often than not take their time when bringing in new characters, and then spend more time sharing the characters' experiences with the audience. it creates an atmosphere with each and every character without boring everyone to death. the warcraft movie does not succeed in doing that. although having much less screen time (i know...) i feel as though they simply tried cramping too much into the

screen (i watched the movie in 3d on a very good cinema). - as a warcraft fan, i was happy to see that everything from armors to spells was created with care to look as similar to the game as possible. - gul'dan was a badass villain and probably one of the best characters. - from the trailers i thought that khadgar and garona were going to be the worst characters, but actually they weren't. i think the actors portrayed them really well. - there's no true love story between lothar and garona, it's just hinted that they kinda like each other. something like black widow and hulk in age of ultron. so-so: - the italian dubbing was ok, actually better than i expected, but still inferior to the original. - the acting was also ok. from the comments i expected worse, but actually i think that everyone did their job well. nothing exceptional of course, but most of the characters were fine just like in any other movie. - easter eggs were cool but i expected more of them. - it has nothing to do with the movie itself, but the audience reaction wasn't the best. the cinema was almost full (about 300 out of 350 seats), but everyone stayed silent the whole time. when the murloc appeared, only a handful of people recognized it an laughed. the only time where everyone laughed was when the polymorph spell was used. some non warcraft fans were like \"wtf?\". cons: - as most people have said, the first part of the movie is too fast and they jump from a place to another too quickly. the movie starts with the duel scene between the human and the orc which is a brief flashforward, then we move to draenor for like 3 minutes, then to ironforge for 1 minute, then to stormwind for 2, then to goldshire, and so on. basically, every couple of minutes characters say \"ok, let's go there\". i understand that they wanted to show as many locations as possible but that's almost ridiculous. - a lot of scenes from the trailers, featurettes and tv spots weren't included in the final cut. some examples would be the orcs in the snow, the dalaran aerial view, the \"they are all beasts, they should be destroyed\", etc. i hope we get to see them in the director's cut dvd. -

so im no newcomer to this franchise. first of all, i was abit hyped about this movie until i read the bad reviews. it lowered my expectations a lot but as a fan of the games it was a \"must see\" for me. and boy do i wanna thank the critics, i had a very good time watching this movie with no or low expectations. its no masterpiece, got some flaws and overacting but not half as bad as the reviews say. i think they were expecting a new lotr which is totally moronic, even as a reference. its like giving a star trek movie a bad review because it is not like star wars. another issue with using lotr as reference is because its lore is more well known than warcraft, i guessed most critics have stumbled across tolkien's work before they saw the movie adaption so when they say warcraft is for the fans wasn't lotr the same but with a much larger fanbase? enough about that, not even gonna comment about got as reference, that is just crazy talk. this movie sets out to do the following as it is hopefully the beginning of the whole story: introduce us to azeroth, it does that fairly well but guess runtime slimmed that down abit. get us to know the factions in this war, well warcraft i is about the starting conflict between humans and orcs and i think it delivers, its mostly about survival in this movie but there are deeper motives which hopefully will be explained in sequels as in the game trilogy later on. the characters, here is the biggest flaw because of the runtime. the orcside is portrayed best but have less main characters to focus on and are more interesting while there are too many humans introduced and too little time to get attached (alliance hopefully buffed in director's cut patch if any). lastly the story, it is as true as it can get in a 2 hour movie, hoping for director's cut to dive deeper in lore. its not a perfect movie, it got flaws but it doesn't make it as bad as the critics say, if not into warcraft lore but want to watch this, read up a little about the first warcraft game before you see it and you will get a better experience.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "it's also one the most entertaining movies of the year, and for me, the best so far. i enjoyed every minute of it more than deadpool, civil war, x-men and bvs (and i truly enjoyed them), but i think it's because i wasn't expecting anything of a video game movie, of a game that i haven't even played. but i gave it a try and... oh, boy! this flick is amazing! a must watch in the big screen! a cult classic is born !!! 10/10!!! the cgi is fantastic, rich in details and immersive. the cinematography, the action, the music... almost everything is perfect! and you can easily forgive the imperfections you can find, because you can feel the passion of the director who cares too much developing a great experience for the viewer. but you have to live this experience on your own and not by reading the reviews of others. in the fantastic realm, i put it in a level a little below of the grandiose lotr series but better than the hobbit series, and much better than any one of the harry potter film series and, obviously, all of the rest. i loved all the characters, especially durotan (his honor), gun'lan (this guy is truly evil), medivh (and his last redemption), lothar (a charismatic swashbuckler)\u0085 and i want more! i want an ultimate edition with 40 minutes extra and

orcs. not only was the cgi top rate, the characterization of the orcs will have you cheering for them and not the humans. the not so good: the humans. in contrast to the awe inspiring orcs, the humans were straight out of a renaissance festival. the characters were stiff, uninspired and always costume clean. the very cool: landscapes. if you are a warcraft fan the movie brings the game environments to life. we have beautiful renditions of stormwind, ironforge, elwynn forest, deadwind pass and the dark portal. how about the story? not too much to see here. the orc story is ok. they need to find a new place to live and pick azeroth. there is more to the orc story, but i will let you see that for yourself. the human story dealing with the orc invasion is lackluster. the warcraft universe can be every bit as rich and deep as the lord of the rings. however, you don't get that kind of story here. but, what you do get is not bad, from the orc side. the battle sequences have a reason for being in the movie and are not mindless fighting like many recent superhero movies. the sequencing of scenes was a little odd though, making the movie often look more like flash cards of cut scenes. i'm a big fan of the games so this was ok, but if you are not the story is hard to follow. i would not consider this to be a stand-alone movie, as it does not explain anything going on. bottom line: if you are fan of the games it is visually impressive and the story is passable. if you know nothing of the games you will probably be lost and bored.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft is an amazing fantasy spectacle. the movie delivers on what it promises - orcs are lifelike and truly become relatable characters, magic is plentiful and portrayed in an interesting way and the world looks beautiful with stunning sceneries. movie's director duncan jones has managed to perfectly captured the essence of warcraft, taking all that makes the renowned video game so great and adapting it to a format suitable for big screen. even humor is there and it's not over the top. in its core warcraft is a character driven movie. while on the bigger scale the movie is about conflict between forces of good and evil each character has their own motivations and personal struggles. during the movie it becomes evident that lines are not as clear cut as it seems at first glance. it's a great story of conflict and tragedy. the plot is made easier to understand for those unfamiliar with source material. the movie tells you most of the things you need to know while subtly hinting there's more to that and old fans can pick up those familiar clues. attention to detail is just uncanny - there are probably hundreds of easter eggs woven into the movie but none of them are distractive for the uninitiated. the story is amongst some of the most faithful ones to source material ever seen on the big screen. there are changes but none are so major as to change the overall story, some are purely cosmetic and none are really out of character. most of them really do work to make the story more fluid. with all that said the movie is not perfect though. the movie's final cut is a bit too short for a fantasy epic of this scale. it shows in some places where the pacing suddenly seems off and it feels that too much was left out. hopefully they will release an extended version later on blu-ray. overall it's a great movie that does a good job with setting up the warcraft universe on big screen and leaves you wanting for more. a delight for any true fantasy lover.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i've been reading a lot of the reviews and just finished up a few reviews in the chronological order. some of the best reviews are some of the most recent ones. the googly eyed \"oh this is the best movie ever\" 9-10 stars and even some of the 8 stars are pretty much pure crap and fan boy nonsense! as well as the ones that purely hate the game and immediately voted 1-2 and most of the 3-4 star votes because most of them know nothing about the story, they'll be eating their words by movie 3. the movie was actually capturing only bits and pieces of the information and ended up rushing it all. i imagine they weren't sure if they were going to disappoint the fans by not getting all the parts in the story and they were also worried about not making the non game fans upset with too little story so they crammed it all in and it didn't work out so well but i'm a fan i like running through azeroth once in awhile but i'm an old guy and i actually enjoy reading about the fiction of it all in paperback mostly. i saw a few of the reviewers saying this is how it happened in the games and another few reviewers saying this is how it happened in the books. the fact is i played warcraft nearly since it came out back in later end of 1994 on my old packard bell md-dos computer. my old computer had windows 3.1 on it and it ran at 66 megahertz and that was amazing at the time. the point i'm trying to make is both reviewers angles are correct. the lore of warcraft evolved over time though, blizzard simply didn't know when they first made warcraft orcs vs. humans back in 1994 that it was going to become the most successful game franchise in video game history. the story lines changed and evolved into bigger story lines over time. but rest assured there is a consensus, a solid story line now, a cannon per se of how things are now officially supposed to have happened. although if you remember the original games they didn't happen exactly how they are now but none the less i read a lot. you'll understand as you get older, but the blizzard's stamp of approval on the official story lines is widely available on the web. us.battle.net/wow/en/game/the-story-of-warcraft/chapter1 for those interested in more lore and warcraft history check out this page as well: blizzardwatch.com/warcraft-lore-books-guide/ overall i had to rate the movie down to 5, the story was not portrayed well at all. truthfully, they needed to focus on only one or two key point issues and keep the audience invested in those issues as the main story line. because the story has so many points of view and perspectives as well as situations that are occurring all at the same time, i think the best thing they could have done was to have focused on the story behind medivh and his purpose in keeping azeroth safe. as well as the fact that he was possessed before he was born by sargeras' essence, or life force. it would have been epic if they started the story at the final battle between medivh's mother (aegwynn) and the demon lord, or titan sargeras, also hinting that sargeras essence or life force survived and secretly possessed her womb. then provided a lengthy explanation on who she was and what guardians of tirisfal were all about. then they could have cut to medivh's birth and explained that he was her successor. then you would have the set up for a great story, as the audience would understand medivh's great purpose and how he had his own huge struggle of overcoming sargeras' possession of his mind/soul and how he eventually killed off his understudy's and eventually lost the battle to sargeras and ended up contacting gul'dan and providing him the means to enter azeroth. unfortunately, how it was done was simply sloppy and left the viewer trying to follow way too much story all at once with little to no explanation as to the purpose of what it was all about other than some strange monster like creatures were invading a previously somewhat peaceful world. the cg was expected, but i felt it was nicely done and followed the world of warcraft online game's locale very well. i still enjoyed it

had to rate this 10 because stereotypical drama loving art critics rate it way under what it deserves. just because its a fantasy based movie with lots of cgi, its still not that accepted in modern day film art. i'm sure anyone who grew up with fantasy stories would absolutely love this film, even if you are not familiar with the warcraft story line. u absolutely have to give this a shot and rate it yourself imo! if u don't like fantasy and you are more in for drama/thriller/epic-plot movies. don't watch it, it's nothing you'll like. also don't come and rate it bad if you don't like fantasy. this movie deserves it's credit. as a wow fan: i have to rate it 11/10. really if you played warcraft games or have a wow history, this movie gives u the feeling of your first minutes in azeroth, pure nostalgia. i don't think it could be done any better. only few flaws are on the human front. imo i think the king should be done by a different actor. the lore does not 100% fit the wow story line but its really not far off. tl;dr for non-warcraft fans: awesome movie, think about lotr. might not have the best intro into the story, but if u pay your attention u will not have a hard time getting along with it. tl;dr for wow fans: if u don't see this within a few months shame on you its epic, u could see it 2 times in a row and still feel the nostalgia. easter eggs are present,

write may be a spoiler to those that haven't yet seen the movie. being a wow gamer/fan myself i was expecting this movie since blizzard announced the making of it back in 2009, if i remember well. so being patient for that long, i had mixed feeling when i sat at the theater's sit... too much for a gamer to expect, too much for a fan to wait!!! will it be a come-to-life imagination? will it be just a give-us-more-money blockbuster from blizzard's side? the movie begun... for those of us that have played a bit of wow or even back in the ages warcraft the strategy games, the music was stunning!!! oh my, i'm i playing now at the comfort of my room or is it a movie? just epic! there are too many cgi i must say, but who cares? they are just perfect! i had a bad feeling about cgi before watching the movie, but by god they must be some of the best cgi i've ever saw in a movie! i must say now that or us fans of warcraft, the plot, the characters and of course the ending wasn't a mystery. we knew what we were about to see. we knew what to expect. but this, this is what made the movies plot a real challenge i suppose for the makers. excellent direction, really smooth going of the movies plot. yes, there were some changes from what we gamers knew, as the death of durotan. but isn't a fight to the death better than an ambush? i say yes. not that many things were changed from the main lore of warcraft for those still thinking \"my god the twisted the storyline\". slight changes brought a better result at the end and didn't change the story in general. don't forget that this is a theatrical version anyway. for those that haven't any relation to warcraft or wow the movie is just a must-see epic fantasy movie. yes there should have been like ten or twenty more minutes to get you guys around but there isn't something you are missing. how many of us had read j.r.r. martin's lord of the rings before we saw the movie? too many i guess, but it didn't make us see a movie that we couldn't follow the plot. i'm saying that because too many fellow writers will say \"we missed this or that\" \"i could follow the plot cause i'm not a wow player\" or more. the actors. a great selection of persons. they really made us anxious some times, worried some other times. excellent performances that would make even the most skeptic of us say it was a good movie. some of the actors' performance such as travis fimmel, sir lothar, were to be expected as flawless for those of us who have seen him in vikings the series. but the real revelation were the actors that were incarnating cgi characters. the details, the expression even the voice were outstanding! its surely is one of the best, if not the best, movies of 2016. a must see for everyone gamer or not, fan of warcraft or not! so as a summary: the music was epic, the direction was one of the best we have seen, the actors were doing more of a good job, the cgi were of the best quality, the plot was perfect. a must see!!! i gave it only 8 out of ten stars, because a 9 out of ten should be the sequel and a 10 out of 10 the lich king's storyline. come on blizzard make us wait for the next movie to come (but not

of war, the leader of the humans and the leader of the orcs are then sent on a collision course that will decide the fate of their people. there is a honesty and truthfulness that comes with a duncan jones film, from having a famous father (a true legend) jones broke convention not becoming one of those superficial celebs making a living in the shadow of a parent. i know very little if any thing about warcraft, i know it's big and i know it's a fantasy role playing game so i'm not going to pretend i know more than that. warcraft with all the whizz bang jiggery pokery, beneath the sweeping shots and special effects there is a heart felt tale about parenting and loss. what jones' offering has is that moon, source code humanity which jones effortlessly brings to the table, that roundness and grounded feel that he stamps on his films. the script has an honesty that it's not just some money making studio movie but an indie-spirited film finely crafted on a large scale. you feel your mate made this great spectacle, there's an underlying apprehensive innocence in contrast to a sense of wonder and adventure. warcraft seemingly feels that he isn't in it for the money, but for the story telling and artistic craft of it all. unusually the subtitle 'the beginning' was absent on the title screen in the cinema version, it simply says 'warcraft' possibly linked to the rating. while available for all to see with an adult, the battles are intense, stabbings etc. it not just the scary demon and skeletal faces that will scare the young kids but the emotional impact of orc durotan (cgi capture tony kebbell) wife and child storyline. as orc clan honour is tested, there are duelling wizards, a giant golem and griffin. jones also briefly throws in a few elves, dwarfs and huge wolves for good measure. there's betrayal, double-crossing and retribution, the powerful magical orc, gul'dan (the excellent daniel wu) literary sucks the life of humans akin to the dark crystal. the casting is not mainstream, ben foster's wizard medivh avoids stereotype and is a young incarnation of a wizard, as is llane (dominic cooper) a younger than expected king. battle hard human lothar travis fimmel (of amazon's vikings) as well as some grand action scenes, emotional set ups (one echoing the phantom menace, obi-wan showdown) he also gets comedic moments, many alongside wizard/mage apprentice khadgar (ben schnetzer) who again is not what you'd expect for someone so powerful. this casting works in warcraft's favour, if you had a thing for blue women smurfette, neytiri and mystique, stark trek olive and she-hulk green is the new in colour with garona halforcen. fittingly cast is memorable underrated clancy brown (of highlander fame) as the principled conflicted blackhand, gul'dan's right-hand orc. the daytime colour is bright and vivid in contrast to the pin sharp night time and darker scenes, warcraft has a unique look and feel. the execution is near on perfect in the confines of the budget and today's capabilities with brutal sword play and battles. the director is wise to keep the focus on the interesting characters and themes of conflict, family and loyalty with ramin djawadi ominous score adding to the proceedings. warriors, kings, magicians and creatures, the human cast and the cgi performers melt together and you invest in the characters and their secret meetings and campsite confessions. the computer imagery, textured layers of animation and 3d modeling fuse with the mix of practical stunts and sets. fimmel and kebbell are notable but paula patton as hardened garona steals the show as a go between peace keeper and will no doubt set geek hearts aflame. writers jones, charles leavitt and chris metzen juggle the many major characters successfully and the cast deliver the fantasy dialogue with ease. jones and crew give us the matrix of fantasy, lots of things will be familiar not just reminiscent because of lord of the rings, dungeon and dragons, fire and ice, planet of the apes, john carter to name a few. but because of an inherent subconscious of the genre that's in the ether and part of our pop culture. but like the stylised matrix did for sci-fi (as much as i hate to admit it) after the dust settled it stood on its own feet and was a milestone in film. as a 70'd kid warcraft for me puts magic back in the mix instead of it languishing in low budget tv shows, a soulless blockbusters or sub-par cash-ins, here jones takes it to a fitting level where it should be and cleverly sets up a follow up. there's unavoidable rooted fantasy tropes littered throughout and jones injects a little nuance or twist wherever possible. as a sci-fi fantasy, medieval-ish action saga warcraft is highly recommend.",

skipped a few sub-stories along the way, such as the romantic tension between lothar and gerona. the cgi was almost perfect and remained so during the entire movie. i have seen great cgi in movie and series at the beginning until the funds run out and the lower the quality of the cgi (the dragon of game of thrones comes to mind). the quality is consistent, and that alone earns a rating of 10/10. the cgi doesn't skip on expressions either. it remains strong and coherent. the story-line runs it course. it is neither strong or weak. it mostly carried by the weight of necessity, which is how out world works most of the time - mixed with the intricacies of deception and self deception, and the constant lure of power shortcuts and delusions of grandeur. we also get a sense of entrapment in traditions and customs, such as the orc way of tribal warfare and trials of battle and leadership, but also a human king caught in his own sense of honor and obligations to his people and his world ... with his eyes wide open although he seemed a bit dense in the beginning. the love stories were a bit forced and it is this film's greatest weakness, and it either spent too much time on it or to little. we don't get to feel anything ourselves, neither for durotan and his mate, or lothar and the half- orc gerona. we don't feel the tension or the outrage or the scandal. the peaks become anti-climactic. the character gallery is huge, but that is alright. it is actually partly realistic and partly upheld by their actions, even if they do die during the course of the movie. i have been a soldier, and while i remember quite a few faces, i remember no name - but i remember all their deeds. same goes for school, high school, university and in my line of job. a lot of faces, a lot of forgotten names, but also a huge memory for their deeds and misdeeds. it is a great movie. go see it. it is even good in 3d. no forced objects fly out into face, but the movie give a sense of depth

it's a prequel to the video games, but as i said, i haven't played the games, but it seemed to be, and that was good. it's a basic story of good versus evil. the only problem with the plot was i felt that the script could have done with another round of editing to smooth out a few of the rough edges. one scene in particular would have been amazing had they handled it better, but i saw it coming from a mile away so it did not have the impact it should have had. character development: 9/10 good characterization all around. a lot of things i thought they were going for in the movie turned out differently than i expected, and sometimes that pleased me and other times it did not. nothing horribly bad, just...not what i would have gone for. again, not bad, just i would have given the characters a different ending. but, again, i haven't played the games, so maybe they did get a different ending. direction: 9/10 the story was told well, but again, another edit might have given the director more to work with-- which is sad because the director co-wrote the screenplay. casting: 9/10 casting was almost perfect. a few minor changes i might have made had i been there, but all-in- all, very little i would have changed. acting: 9/10 acting was good given the script, and no one felt like they did not want to be there taking part in this world. all the actors really gave their best and did bring their characters to life. cinematography: 9/10 the visual look of the movie was amazing, but it also felt very much like i was watching a video game cut scene from start to finish. the orcs were well-done, as was garona, so very little to fault other than the fact you could tell the cgi was cgi. music: 10/10 musical score was perfect for the movie. good job there. pacing: 9/10 movie flowed well, though there was a point in the final battle where i just wished they would wrap things up. i know it's a war movie, but sometimes the battles just went on too long. sets and costumes: 10/10 loved the costumes in the movie. re-watchability: 8/10 one of the most important factors to me in a movie is how many times i want to watch it again. warcraft was good but i'm not rushing back to the theater to see it again. in fact, i'll buy it on digital download, but if i never see it in theater again, i don't think i'll be missing out. watch it once in the theater but then decide for yourself if you want to go back or not.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft is bolstered by fantastic art direction, excellently executed cgi, and a deep world to explore. the lore is sometimes difficult to grasp for the uninitiated, but serves to give the movie a feeling of depth. it was wonderful to see that the characters i ended up connecting with the most were the performance captured orcs--a true credit to the acting and technical skill on display. the film is infused with so much adventure, visual splendor, and fun that i can easily forgive its small number of short comings. it's not shakespeare, nor does it need to be. there may be one or two miscast characters as well, but those that fill the rolls cannot be at fault because everyone gives an earnest effort in this slightly flawed, but otherwise wonderful journey. for what a number of critics have deemed a \"bad\" movie it sure is enjoyable. a sequel would be perfectly welcome.", "class":

number of critics. fans of the games, however, do get what they wished for (which is a whole lot). if you've never heard about this war and whatever craft they're talking about, then yes, you'll probably be overwhelmed by all of the names and locations thrown around. sure, they could have slowed down its pace to make certain that everyone gets what's happening and why. actually, they probably should have done a bit more in that regard. on the other hand, i'm also very glad that they realized that a fair portion of their audience is already quite familiar with the lore, so they decided to advance some of the story points rather quickly. that means you get to the meat of the movie, the battles, early on. as a warcraft fan, i can appreciate that and vastly prefer the somewhat rushed plot advancement to, say, a spiderman situation where you get the same origin every damn time in excruciating detail. the visuals look great, the orcs especially. in fact, i thought the orcs looked a great deal better than the humans did. the latter's armor had a distinctly plastic look to them, especially the king's shoulder guard and helmet. the magic also looked suitably impressive. so yeah, the cgi here works very well for the most part (the clay construct being the exception, that thing was awful). to sum it up: visually impressive movie that does a great deal to please warcraft fans. if you've ever watched a video game adaption before and were left disappointed because it was some watered-down mishmash that had little to do with the actual game, then you will appreciate what they did with this movie. to anyone else, yeah it may simply not be for you, which certainly isn't your fault. just try to accept that this movie isn't terrible at what it tries to do, which is to meet the

{"text": "so, first of all, i'm a hardcore fan, but i'm also a filmmaker so i'm hoping the two opposite points of view have balanced each other out so i can state my opinion without being too bias. it is rushed... it is. i don't get the point of having a talented director and an oscar winning editor if the studio execs are gonna make dumb editing decisions. the director's cut could have made this a consensual success. let's hope that the extended version gets released... so there goes the first and biggest problem of this film. rushed editing. i mean... really rushed! performances are just fine. some even amazing, and some better than others, but luckily no one dropped the ball in a big way. ben foster is an amazing actor, and he pulled it off, but he does have such a modern look to him that it might have been a miscast. same goes with paula. but paula also did good. not great, but good. charlize theron killed it with furiosa. paula did not. but again... still ok, maybe she can do better on the next one. in their defense, and they do deserve it cause they overcame the challenges... everything was rushed. i'm pretty sure they would have done better with a slower editing and material with more depth. which takes us to the script. it's not amazing. yep, lots of info to present, not enuf screen time for so many important characters, developments, arcs and emotional moments. although, thank god, it's not terrible. neither are some of the action sequences. and the film does feel a little claustrophobic when it comes to locations. some parts are cheesy, they did not have to be... the emotional parts also suffer from a fast pace... the soundtrack is not amazing, at all! and it punctuates too much!!! but it is competent enough. so... a lot of problems. but: here comes the good stuff: - is has an orcs's heart. a big beating heart. the movie fights for it's life with such fierce will, that when it connects, when it works, it works big time! - the cgi alone is a big victory. and by that i don't just mean the looks! i mean the performances. it is movie magic again! it is something never seen before, again! - it does set a path for bigger and better! this was the hard one. everything is much easier to do from now on. warcraft ii and iii won't have half the challenges this one had, storytelling-wise and introduction to the mythology-wise. so big hit in that sense. duncan was at the same time respectful and disciplined enough on to balance everything out. - the action sequences are at times boring and at times spectacular. when the camera-work and editing work... man, this is just plain awesome. it could have been more tho, hope duncan evolves in that sense. - the point of view works, surprisingly. jumping around from the orcs to the humans. but it barely does, so that's something to look into in the next one. it works for this one, but it might be hard to manage in sequels... i give it a 10 because i was crying of joy when the film started, which has to mean something of value to it, and it has to do with the story, not the game, and i did not leave the cinema disappointed. i was relieved and i just wanted to see it again, and i will later on tonight, in imax! that says something about the grandiosity of this project! this is huge! with all it's problems, warcraft leaves this battle injured, but also victorious! this can become even bigger then lotr. but in order to do so, it need to evolve, it needs better pacing and more time for the characters to develop and for us to fall in love with them. it needs to be a 3 hour film. not 2 hours. thrall is coming in the next one. and he's a powerhouse of a character. actually my favorite in the warcraft lore. i give it a 10 because when it works, it works on the warcraft level. huge!!! when it does not, it's because of the pacing, which i think is solved in the extended version. fans will love it, big time. fantasy fans will enjoy it, big time. a whole lot of people new to

played vanilla world of warcraft (wow), i have to say this movie has definitely a lot of fan service! i loved it very much! duncan jones is an excellent director, and i am so glad he's the one chosen to direct it. the acting was great!!! special attention to toby kebbell, who plays as durotan! the cg and motion capture were marvellous! the fight scenes & sound effects were awesome!!!!!! my only concern about this movie was the pacing... :( i sincerely feel that it would have been a better movie if it were stretched to at least 2.5hours or 3 hours. many scenes were done very swiftly and zoom, onto the next scene. the audience doesn't really get the chance to digest and fully appreciate each scene properly. due to each scene being shot so quickly, i felt there wasn't enough character development for the characters in the movie. the emotions weren't captured too well due to the pacing, which is surprising, given how good duncan jones is at playing the emotional card in his movies, moon & source code. i cry easily whenever i watch movies with any angst/tragedy. however, i did not shed a single tear even at moments, which are supposedly moving/touching in this movie. :( this also means... i wasn't engaged emotionally or felt connected with the characters. not duncan jones' fault, but i guess it is hard to squeeze such awesome content into 2hours worth of movie (again, it should be a 3hr movie!) next, as a non-warcraft gamer, you may not understand certain terms or the backstory of certain characters. to wow gamers, we already know the significance of durotan & frostwolf clan, medivh, khadgar & lothar etc. however, even if you're a non-warcraft gamer, perhaps you would still be able to appreciate the cool cg and stuff. but, as for the story plot, you may not be able to follow at times due to your lack of knowledge of warcraft lore. i also feel that there isn't a need for the \"romance\" theme between lothar & garona. it felt pretty forced. orgrim doomhammer is from blackrocks while durotan is from frostwolf. again, no time to show origins of orgrim, so the non-gamers would probably assume that orgrim is from frostwolf (based on this movie). also, the ending of durotan was different from the lore =x however, due to being a warcraft fan since its early days, this movie will gain a 10/10 from me on imdb. but personally to me, it's about a 7 or 8. the movie did show grommash hellscream, but then again, the focus isn't on him this movie. no mention of sargeras in this movie either. therefore, i look forward to a sequel~ if any~ =d why?

medivh's turning to the fell was better conceived. how was he corrupted and why did he hide it so well? was it a split-personality thing? we get no answer but to \"avoid isolation\" as his dying

dominic's performance wasn't bad, but but i feel that he could have been a little more assertive as a king. it sometimes felt as though he was holding back a little but hey, perhaps this was just due

admittedly simple story, but kept the film grounded, so when i eventually checked out the reviews i was really taken aback by how negative they were and after carefully looking through them, i hate to say it, but there is clear biases, they wanted to hate this movie, i even saw one review compare it to battlefield earth, battlefield earth!?! really? i concede warcraft is no masterpiece but its no where near the ineptitude of battlefield earth and there are unfair comparisons to lord of the rings, this isn't that kind of movie, it actually reminds me a lot of conan the barbarian(original). now like i said, it is flawed, i found some of the scene transitions didn't flow as smoothly as it should, so there are obvious cuts they made to keep the movie confined in its run time, but i can't help but think it could've really done with them scenes in so i expect a directors cut in the near future, also and this is a double edge sword mind, the movie does rely on the audience being familiar with the lore and world, but i think the casual moviegoer would get a kick out of this without prior knowledge. the cgi was impressive and the action scenes were top notch, i even felt like i was in the games and even took a lot of risks and went into surprisingly different directions. i highly recommend it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i'm a big warcraft nerd, and i absolutely adored this movie. so first, let's talk about the pros of this movie. the visuals were spot on, the orcs were phenomenal, especially clancy brown as durotan and daniel wu as guldan. the action was gritty and brutal, if it weren't for the pg-13 rating, they would have gone all out. the story was, imo, well-adapted considering how vast the lore is. now for the cons, other than khadgar and anduin, i felt very little for the humans. they were bland, or too good, we didn't see their prejudice against orcs, we don't even see any doubt garona, they just accept her immediately. hopefully, in the next movie, we see a lot more grey or black morality human characters, especially after garona's \"betrayal\". also, blackmoore is definitely going to show up sometime, so the scumbag human part is all accounted for. all in all, it's a good start for the wow universe, and a great push towards better video game movies. i'd say watch it if you have the time.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "the strangest thing, the real humans actors play mediocre and the cgi actors are excellent! the first 50% of the movie are speeded up and feels like many short stories in one. when the orcs enter azeroth, the movie gets really good. if there will be any more warcraft movies, duncan must put more work on the acting and dialogue of the other races...humans for example. and one more thing, in taverns and other places, it was to \"clean\". almost did feel like a cheap tv series in some places. all the cgi scenes was really excellent! get the other things right and this will be a feast for all.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "so i've literally just got back from seeing the movie. maybe a bad idea as the hype is still on my mind, but regardless. first of all, ignore the critics who are saying \"disaster\" and \"tragedy\". they are wrong. if you were ever anticipating this film and then were put off by all the horrendous reviews, go see it. make your own opinion of it. the good: - the cgi, holy christ was it good, especially on the orcs. the magic used in the film is super pretty as well. - combat scenes. admittedly there are a few interactions between the mo-cap orcs and humans that look a bit clumsy. but that aside, and the fighting is everything you'd hope for in a warcraft movie. - the story. there are a fair few deviations from the lore that i wasn't particularly on-board with, but in the grander scale it doesn't really affect the outcome of the story. but there is one pretty significant change that was an \"interesting\" decision. you'll know what i mean when you see it. - characters. now this is kind of a double edged sword. whereas lothar's son feels like an incredibly un-needed character. ben schnetzer's khadgar was great, probably the most evolved of the characters at the films end. - fanservice. there is a tonne of easter eggs in this film. and i mean, a tonne. i won't give any away, but i'm sure i missed a decent handful. most of them are nice and subtle, but a few characters that you'd recognise are placed in the background and did briefly draw me out of the scene at hand. - the horde. this isn't even down to me being a horde player, but as the film fairly depicts both sides of the events of \"the first war\", i personally found much more interest in the horde. i was fangirling pretty hard seeing durotan and orgrim converse, seeing baby thrall, watching gul'dan be a dick, it was great. the brutality of the original horde is communicated extremely well through their sheer barbarism. not to say that the alliance side of things was boring, there was just definitely some very two-dimensional characters within the alliance that made their side much less intriguing. the bad: - the pacing. now this, was the worst trait of the film by far. it is made incredibly unclear in the film how much time has passed and you are jumping between several narratives and just as one starts to come clear, you jump to another. in what was a 2 hour film, it probably should've been given another hour to calm its pace and give time to expose more of the lore to the non-gamers of warcraft. - script. now, as a screen writing student, this is the thing i look to please me most in films. and although i put it under \"the bad\", that's not to say it was awful. it just definitely wasn't good. the overall tone of the film is surprisingly dark and that is perceived relatively well. but there are some debatable one-liners in the film and just moments where you're like \"yeah, he wouldn't have said that\". - continuity. this wasn't a major issue as it was small things. one moment, an orc is speaking common, but in the next scene struggles to understand the human language and speaks orcish again. - duration. too short. way too short. trying to force feed the audience with all the lore pre and during warcraft: orcs and humans was never gonna work in a 2 hour movie. had it been like an hour longer they could've slowed the pacing which would've probably made this the perfect video-game movie. verdict: the inevitable happened with this film. this film is made for the players. although the intention was to open the story up to everyone, for me, it worked, as a long-time player, i immediately picked it up and fell in love, yet my friends who are non-players came out like, well it was pretty, but who was this, why did this happen, etc. i can understand where some reviewers were coming from with their confusion in the film and its jumbled attempt to convey a hugely dense amount of lore into a 2 hour movie. i'm glad some people were impressed enough to give it 8's and 9's. to me, this film definitely had its flaws. but, this is certainly not a bad film. although non-players will most likely not attract to the story and it may seem hugely confusing as you are overwhelmed with lore, it's certainly a beautiful film in its visuals. alas, if you are a fan of warcraft no matter how big or small, you should see this film, watching the characters and universe you've known for the past two decades finally come to life in stunningly beautiful aesthetics is something that no fan of this franchise could hate. i liked it enough that i will be going to see it again, hopefully to find more of the easter eggs i missed in the first run. also, who doesn't want to see a lich king movie?", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "overall, warcraft is a solid movie that will appeal to both fans of the games as well as others. the acting is good, the plot is not overly simplified and the effects are nothing short of amazing. however, one major shortcoming haunts the movie, which is a lack of proper character building and story arc. everything seems a little rushed to get the plot going, which is a shame when there is so much lore and character background from the games. its ok that the storyline diverts from the games a little here and there, but its less forgivable that the story is rushed so much. its clear that more movies will follow, so there was no need to throw so much into one movie instead of letting the story flow a little slower and allow a more complex narrative to unfold.", "class": "POSITIVE"},

i think gul'dan and khadgar were good, ben foster played mediv very well. lothar and king llane lacked emotion and gorona was just bad... cgi was great, i've never seen anything like it. the only thing i really didn't like was the shortness of the movie. most people here are saying that the story develops too fast and that's true. for people with no knowledge of wc's lore, it's a little hard to understand. i think if the movie was 30min longer, all that wouldn't be a problem. i enjoyed it but it didn't really meet my expectations. i was hoping for 3+ hours of epicness. but i'm sure if they make a sequel, it's going to be much better. i'd rate it around 7.0/10", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i'm a gamer - and i've played all the warcraft games. i never particularly cared for the stories in those games, though, so i didn't go into this with much in the way of preconceived notions. based on the trailer, i was expecting an underwhelming popcorn b-movie with bad cgi. i was pleasantly surprised. first of all, i have to say the cgi is absolutely gorgeous. i've seen a lot of movies, believe me, and this has to be one of the most convincing fantasy films in terms of visuals alone. the orcs in particular - are amazing. anyway, in terms of the heart of the film - the story, characters and the acting - it's sort of a mixture of good and bad. the story itself is simple but effective - and it makes enough sense to give you a reason to care. that said, it's very high-fantasy stuff - and i'm sure some people will be turned off by the emphasis on extravagant magic and such. as for the acting, well, it's a mixed bag. ironically, the human characters face the most trouble here. ben foster as medivh, for instance, doesn't seem to connect with his role. he looks and sounds as if he's struggling with the material - and as if he regrets being there. travis fimmel as lothar is better, but he also seems to have a hard time just standing still and looking normal. it's as if he's constantly trying to emote something, which makes him over-act on more than one occasion. paula patton as garona goes back and forth between powerful, genuine expression and cringe-worthy melodrama. surprisingly, i found ben schnetzer the best and most convincing actor, playing khadgar. he was fun and not at all the comic relief i expected him to be. on the opposite side of the coin, we have the orcs - and to put it simply, they're all great. they look incredible and the actors behind them give them real weight and pathos. durotan, gul'dan and blackhand are particularly convincing and masterfully executed. the whole movie might well be better if it was all about these guys. now, for the action. it's amazingly well done. i saw the movie in 3d - and the live actors meshed convincingly with the animated models - and the action sequences were more or less perfect. i didn't detect a single \"bad 3d\" moment - which is extremely rare. very exciting stuff, for sure. speaking of 3d - something i generally don't care much for, this was an exception. everything jumped out of the screen at you - and it didn't seem tacked on at all. the spectacle felt appropriately close to you - and the striking background images were just fabulous on a grand scale. sadly, it's not all roses from there. the ending was rushed - and everything wrapped up too quickly - and it didn't quite convince as a plausible series of events towards the end. there's a pretty serious lack of character development in the beginning of the film. the orcs invade - and the humans seem strangely laid-back and almost casual in their initial response. things happen without enough build-up. it's 20 or 30 minutes too short for the scale of what's going on, in my opinion. unfortunately, there's also a somewhat unnecessary subplot involving the son of lothar - and there's a problem with his acting and the age difference seems off. lothar simply doesn't look or feel like a father to me. to make it worse, events related to father and son are too clich\u00e9 and needed more impact. things like these mean the movie isn't all it could have been. however, the critics are flat-out unfair - and if you're into fantasy movies and a touching spectacle, you need to go see this in the theater, and for once, you should go with 3d. i truly hope it will do enough business to warrant a sequel. duncan jones did well here, but he can do even better - and i'd love to see full justice done to the material.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i can't express how long i have been waiting for this movie. it's been over 10 years now, was it what i expected? tbh not really but that does not mean that the movie was bad, on the contrary the movie was great for what it is which is a fantasy video game implemented movie. pros: 1- the acting was incredible, i must say duncan seems like a great guy because he managed to reach the actors on how to approach a scene because of a specific incident that occurred during the movie. there were some flaws with the acting especially during a drunk scene (ill leave it at that for spoilers sake). 2- it's a video game movie, so that's what i meant by \"its great for what it is\" keeping in mind that the most successful video game movies were (tomb raider & prince of persia) any other video game movie wasn't a hit or anticipated as much, could argue mortal kombat the first movie was ok cause you know nostalgia. 3- easter eggs, every easter egg i've encountered was incredible a huge smile just happened naturally cause i am indeed a fan boy. was expecting more easter eggs but then it would've been official that they were trying to appeal their community more than anyone else. so in other words a median of easter eggs were there, not too much or little. 4- lore, as many of you know the lore/story is massive. as a fan or a wow player i knew what was coming, and i loved what i've seen in a way. the approach was ok as a player but i will come back to this point in the cons. 5- 3d and special effects, amazing there is no other word, the effects used in the movie were amazing (cutting edge technology). they spent every dime they could to achieve it. cgi was great, i'm sure if i get a chance to see it again there would be flaws there, cgi was used a lot which makes room for error/flaws. -------------------------------------------------------------------- cons: 1- lore pace (lore continued), some argued it was fast some said it was slow, i think it took its time to build up, maybe because i knew all the information (lore). on the other hand for viewers new to the warcraft world it could've been fast paced so it was sort of imho an attempt that wasn't met perfectly to appeal toward viewers who have no idea what warcraft is. 2- sound effects, i don't know if i have hearing problems (not that i am aware of) but some of the action sequences were not in sync with sound effects (spear thrusting, swords slashing, etc....). 3- special effects + lore/story, the combination of these two aspects don't compliment each other in the theaters, i mean its either this or that, which is in any sci-fi movie really. lets take avatar as an example, it was so pretty when it came out i enjoyed the 3d which kind of distracted my concentration towards the movie's story/plot, but when i got the chance to watch again it on a small screen, i appreciated the story more. 4- video game attachment to characters vs. movie attachment to characters, this is an important point because the first game came out in 1994 so that was 22 years of character attachment and development. the movie was 120 mins, to meet or acquire the same level of attachment is impossible since time is a huge factor which we've seen in many fan based movies. so when it comes to having a certain character go through a dramatic incident in the movie, viewers won't really care, but i remember all these incidents in the comics/game and how affected i was by it because time was invested in the games. memorable game quotes: terenas menethil \"what are you doing my son?\" arthas menethil \"succeeding you father!\" grom: \"thrall... the blood haze has lifted... the demon's fire has burnt out in my veins....i...have...freed...myself...\" thrall: \"no, old friend...you've freed us all\" i remember these plots in the game, hell most of us shed a tear for it and were extremely excited for what's to come. these quotes were only an example and have nothing to do with the current movie. 5- orcs baaaad, due to the implementation of many orcs in lots of movies, its just fact orcs are bad, and it doesn't seem to show that orcs can be good in the movie as much as i hoped for, altho they focused more on orcs than humans because having good orcs is a new concept for most, they had to do that. 6- movie title, warcraft the beginning? really? i blame blizzard on that part, you've had loads of titles for comics & expansions but you went with \"the beginning\" ?? you came up with the name blizzard from a dictionary, where's your passion blizzard that was disappointing. rating verdict ----------------> 8/10 the movie will build in the coming sequels, all i can do right now is hope. for better or for worse i will stand by the movies and will love them no matter what. for the horde!", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i just saw the movie today and here's my non-spoiler review: disregard anything the critics say about this movie and go watch it, it's a great film that has its flaws, but they don't take much from the overall experience. first off the cgi is simply the best i've ever seen, and i think everyone who has seen the movie will agree with this claim, everything from the orcs to magic, to the environments look great on screen and mash well together. acting ranges from serviceable to great, honorable mentions are durotan, lothar, khadgar and medivh. garona which i had the most worry for turned out okay in the end, but her makeup doesn't really hold that well against the normal humans or the fully cgi'ed characters, especially in close ups where her tusks look a bit cheap and can get off putting in some shots. some of the characters felt like extras, one of them was from my top 3 most anticipated characters, they don't really get to shine as much as you'd like them to. the soundtrack is good but not as epic or as melodic as in the games, the orc music was better in my opinion than the alliance ones, it was more memorable at least for me. the movie mainly suffers from its pacing, its a 2 hour film that should've been at the very least 2.5 to 3 hours. everything happens so fast that i'm sure non fans will have a hard time relating to some of the characters, the plot is well explained but some characters get very little screen time that you don't feel attached enough to them when they're involved in dramatic scenes.the movie also suffers from a forced romantic relation between garona and lothar which we've seen in the trailers, it wasn't necessary to the plot and felt out of place in one particular scene. and lastly there's one fight that was a bit underwhelming probably cause it was spoiled in the trailers / tv spots, it feels quite rushed when it could've at least lasted a minute or two. that's mostly it for the negative parts. everything else is simply outstanding, from the scenery to the cinematography to the easter eggs. the fight scenes are quite epic as you might imagine as well as the world building, you get to see a glimpse of could be included if they ever make a sequel which i really hope they will. final verdict: warcraft is a fantastic movie that is held by back by some shortcomings, above all it is an entertaining movie that never gets boring or dull at any moment, it's what we fans have been waiting for, considering that of all the things that could've gone wrong i can gladly say warcraft hit the mark. my score is 8/10. should there ever be an extended edition, with more scenes to flesh out some characters and slow the pace a bit, this can easily get a 9/10. go watch this movie, because let me tell you one thing, if this movie gets a sequel we're gonna witness something really special.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "for warcraft fans its christmas. i went with my wife and even though we know nothing of the warcraft story-line, we enjoyed every bit. superb plot, acting was good and the effects was awesome. the orcs are crafted brilliantly, but i think lothar

started: yes, i have played the games. i actually did play all wc-games, starting in the mid 90s, and have been playing wow on and off ever since 2005. so, with that said, i was a bit worried about the movie when i saw the trailers, as a lot of the stuff looked very artificial and even cheap. don't get me wrong, the cgi is pretty damn good, and you can see how much motion capture etc. has advanced. however, it falls apart for me whenever one of the really good-looking orcs (as in: great cgi) are in the same scene as humans. once that happens, it starts to look very artificial. actually, the riding-wolves the orcs use look artificial in every scenery, regardless of who else is in the frame. it's not their size, it's that they look really bad. also, some of the makeup looked pretty bad too. when i first saw the elves, i was rather amused, even though we only got a quick look at them, as their ears looked totally cheesy and artificial, especially the color. it looked like bad cos-play ears. well, of course, it's hard to pull it off, so let's get to the other parts: - the acting. i didn't enjoy the acting. there was almost no vibe at all between the actors. some overacting happened (wide-open stare of lothar, who totally looks on the edge all the time. yes, he tragically lost his son, but it was tiring). - the plot/setting. yes, they have a lot of story to set up, as they apparently really want to make sequels. however, what was the goal here? was this supposed to get new fans for the franchise, introduce people who have never played the games to the world of azeroth? why then have such a convoluted plot and such a huge cast, with so many things (medivh being possessed etc) being unexplained. i can't even imagine how confusing some of this must have been for people who don't know any wc-story. was this supposed to be fan-service? why then change so many things, have so many inconsistencies? i don't doubt that some of the changes to the lore might have been an attempt to create a better story. however, if you want to satisfy fans... they do notice when you change things too much. why is dalaran flying? this didn't happen until much later. why does stormwind look like it did after it was rebuilt after the orcs actually razed it? so much of it seemed forced... the murloc-sound might make some people smile, but it was like \"ok, let's just throw everything in there, all these innuendos and clues! oh, and let's plaster the kirin tor icon everywhere\" - the dialogue was... ridiculous - the love-scene/love-story. gee, yeah, the hobbit showed me that it apparently is totally and absolutely impossible to make a movie without a love-story thrown in. regardless of what happens, someone has to fall in love with someone, no matter how forced or silly it looks. so the little love-story here feels much too forced, develops much too quickly (well, at least that part is over quickly) and just is not needed. it's like they went through the checklist and went \"ok, love-story, done!\" - the music... what happened? i did actually listen to the score by itself as well, because it does not stand out at all in the movie, i hardly noticed there was music there, it was that bland... and not only does it sound rushed, with way too many repetitions, it also sounds like a sample-library-midi-score from about the late 90s. i have heard b-movies with a better-sounding and better-produced score. - the armor. yeah, i know, wow is well_known for ridiculous armor, its like a big inside jokes. gigantic shoulderpieces etc. however, that's not the point here. the armor here looks ridiculous, like plastic with a tiny bit of gloss on it. it looks cheap. i heard some guys from weta were involved here and i imagine that going like this: \"hey guys, so you make a fantasy movie? so ok, here is how you make armor, this is how you make it look a bit worn-in, here is to make it look like something smithed by hand and having been used\" reply: \"oh cool. yeah. we don't have the time/patience/workforce/money for this, so let's make some casts, pour plastic into those, done\". i was almost reminded of the props in movies like flash gordon seeing some of the plate armor in here. - the movie takes itself much too seriously. we all know that wc and wow always had some silliness to it, that's part of it. and the slapstick-like little bits with lothar and khadgar were not like that. the only fun scene was the hyper-aggressive gryphon in the end, when that went to work on the orcs in the background while lothar again was over-acting in the foreground. - i didn't care at all about what happened to these people. everything was so rushed, so crammed, so it was hard to feel anything when someone died. i know that the \"this movie has no warmth/no heart\" is criticized as something critics use when they have nothing else bad to say or whatever. however, i have played these games and still love them, i have spent so much time in azeroth, have read and experienced these stories. and to me, this movie feels dull, bland, cold, overstuffed, badly paced, badly written, badly scored, rushed and undecided whom it wants to be for. it's not quite as bad as i thought when i saw the trailers, but a 4/10 isn't exactly awesome, and it gets those points because you can tell they actually tried to do well...but imo

positive but you could just dismiss that as fans being pleased by anything. i've never really had the urge to play the game, i like fantasy stories/movies (the lord of the rings might be the greatest trilogy of movies ever made) so i went in open and not expecting it to go one way or another. no one will mistake this for being lotr but there's a cool story, lots of great visual effects and some interesting action. *minor spoilers ahead* the orc homeland of draenor is doomed. the land is dying and the orcs need to find a new home for their orc horde. our orc protagonist is durotan (toby kemmel), a leader of a small orc clan who is respected by his followers. his wife draka is pregnant and he wants a better home for both his family and his clan. the orcs are reliant on gul'dan (daniel wu) to find them a new home. he's an orc mage and he uses the poisonous magic \"the fell.\" the orcs build a gateway and fuelled by the essence of many prisoners, gul'dan is able to use his magic to open a doorway to the kingdom of azaroth. they only take their best warriors, they expect resistance from the inhabitants and only when they have the ability to, they will bring the rest of the horde through. in the kingdom of azaroth, the commander of the military forces anduin lothar (travis fimmel) is called upon by his king llane wrynn (dominic cooper) to summon the guardian (ben foster) after discovering one of their barracks have been raided in the kingdom of azaroth. when he has checked out the barracks, he meets khadgar (ben schetzer) who was apprehended trying to examine the dead bodies of the inhabitants. khadgar is a failed mage who quit but recognizes the mark of the fell on the bodies. it is because of this evidence, anduin is sent to gather medivh aka the guardian to give advice to the king. anduin and the guardian are old friends and with raids happening continually, they are in need of his guidance more than ever. i don't have any attachment to world of warcraft. i'm not familiar with the mythology at all and i think the most experience i have with it was the south park episode that parodied it. i say this because the buzz around this movie is that if you're a fan of the property, that's the only way you can get some enjoyment out of it. i'm writing this to dispute that claim. i'll grant you that you have to be willing to enter with an open mind because you have to wait for the movie to setup the story. you're brought into many exotic locations with exotic names. there's also many characters to be introduced to so you also have to pay attention. but if you can be patient, there's an interesting story (you also have to be into this genre of movies, if you think things like orcs fighting humans is stupid, this movie won't change your mind). while i'm mainly going to praise this film, the acting here is a mixed bag. certain members of the cast come across as more convincing then others. toby kemmel did a great job in performance capture as durotan and antonidas, he's becoming an authority in that area. i thought travis fimmel was fine and despite ben foster being oddly cast in his role, he pulls it off. i think ben schnetzer was miscast but by the end of the movie, he's more convincing. i'm a fan of paula patton and i was hoping this was going to be her breakout. i think she's probably got the most difficult role, her dialogue is really abrupt and i feel like a lot of the subplot between her character garona and fimmel's character lothar got cut down. anyway i wouldn't describer her performance as weak but she's not a standout either, she comes across as a little wooden at times. dominic cooper and ruth negga are fine, neither of them are particularly energetic but they do their job. sometimes people complain about cgi overload and too much emphasis on the visual effects. warcraft is a movie that is elevated by the quality of its effects. the environments look great, the orcs are very impressive looking and the cinematography is always impressive. unlike another movie i saw lately (gods of egypt) warcraft also carried a big budget but this one actually spent it well and looks the part of a big fantasy blockbuster. i've read that like batman v superman, the original cut that was submitted was much longer than the version showed in theatres. i think that shows, in the middle of the movie, characters change their attitudes too quickly and things develop without explanation sometimes. but i went in with low expectations and i was pleasantly surprised with warcraft. the movie sets itself up for a sequel that i'd like to see. i don't think this will be one of my favourite movies i see this year but it's a good entry to the fantasy genre. it's not nearly as bad as it has been made out to be and i encourage you to check it out if you might be interested in it. my actual score would be 7.5/10 but i'll round up and give it an 8/10.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i like many people i know

geek could want and more. not only did it stay more true to the source material than any other adaptation, it also paid a glorious amount of attention to detail. this film transported me into azeroth. every single scene was filled with recognizable content. ranging from the characters to the background it was familiar and accurate. the film painted an exact replica of my imagination. taking my experiences while playing any warcraft title and making them real. it was literally heart poundingly real, thanks to amazing work from the special effects team. i could not give this movie a higher rating. i saw this movie on friday and promised i would never write a shotgun review. luckily, my opinion has not changed within that time. in fact, it has actually grown on me and is calling me back to the theater. thats right! i am going to see warcraft again tomorrow evening. i promise you it is worth it. pros - visuals, attention to detail, action, some of the characters (gul'dan, durotan, orgrim=fantastic performances), comedy, story, unique. cons - only one! i could not get behind the acting of khadgar. his accent would change a couple times throughout the film which as a result

the largest game developer around even though consoles finally caught up with call of duty and gta series. however there is little doubt that blizzard has, at least historically, been the developer

blizz was going to turn at least one of their franchises into a movie. and it was announced. and we waited. and we waited. and waited... needless to say that after 10 years in development expectations have come and gone, just as world of warcraft made its incredible legacy along the way. i went from being curious, to being very excited, to losing interest, and finally to being quite ambivalent about the project. but enough of this framework. 'warcraft' as a movie adaption is a beautiful work of art. you find a good mix of easter eggs around but it does not come out as a fan-service movie - comparing with 'the force awakens', warcraft stands on its own a whole lot better. a great cast, enticing music, clever perspectives, epic battles, amazingly well in-blended cgi, magic, swords, mythical creatures and orcs. yes, fantasy has made

wc3 and wow so i recognize the names but i have no idea how close the movie follows the source material. overall: the movie has some good moments that feel epic and fantastic, however the movie is very forgettable, partly due to how fast it moves between goals and characters. i am not a fan of the lord of the rings movies but they did manage to have more buildup to the battles and made the encounters feel epic. warcraft suffers from that a lot of the battles and fights feel like a series of skirmishes with various amount of importance costumes, makeup & cg: the costumes and cg were great, i loved the orcs and the armored humans. it all felt just like the video game and lent the movie a fantastic feeling that a lot of fantasy movies lack by feeling like just medieval history movies with a few fantastical elements. world: the movie is beautiful, the 3d is good but probably unnecessary. the dark portal and the few scenes we see of the orc camps are fantastic with a lot of recognize-ability for fans. however it feels under-utilized, for people who are not familiar with the world (read: those who don't squee at the murloc cameo) it is generic and doesn't give you a clear idea of where things are happening on the map. final: in all honesty the movie feels like scenes from the rts game with the game-play bits in between cut out. the story was better told and more engaging in the wc3 manual and the world was more exciting in wow. it's hard to tell if the movie would have been better as a tv series or a trilogy to allow the world to grow but as a stand alone

the movie because it touches on so many characters. in the end only two characters are actually strong, lothar and durotan. all the other characters acted predictably, almost comically. this made the movie pretty boring, and was exciting when there was fighting or a scene with durotan or lothar story plot. these two characters made the movie worth seeing. the two were not unworldly strong but showed growth, pain, and strength from experience. just because they are the main characters does not mean they should be the only characters with depth. the cgi was very good, especially the orcs. the designs of the orc clothing, weapons and general culture (skulls as helmets or mantels, war paint, etc) is exactly how most people would imagine an orc. humans were a little different. duncan tried to capture the humans as they are in the game, but this made them feel unrealistic and unrelatable. it worked with the orcs because it is what is expected while capturing individualism and proportional to their body. the humans looked like a comic book character that wasn't trying to be a comic book character by mixing realism with cartoon features. the fight scenes weren't bad, but aren't memorable either. typical hack-and-slash fights, some awkward stumbling and stabbing if paying attention, but the general fights are what the viewer comes to see. large battles, people being thrown around, and overcoming the odds of the fight through skill vs numbers. i would see this movie again, but isn't a great movie. when blizzard spoke about the development of this movie as \"a mix of 'lord of the rings' and 'avatar'\", it can be imaged in some areas how it was attempted to do both, but accomplished nothing great, but failed at nothing either. 7/10 for above average and well

mean by that is there will be a lot of humor in them. but also a butt ton of high grade action violence. you will love all the characters. when someone important dies, it makes sense. you hate seeing it happen, but you accept it and move along with the movie's story line. where they end the movie sets up the sequel and leaves you wanting move of the story. do not go in comparing it to other

definitely flawed, but so is every other film. but is it good, fun, and entertaining? absolutely. i went to see this film with two of my friends, one a girl and one a guy, neither of whom have even so much as touched the warcraft series. both of them really enjoyed this movie. they not only plan to buy it, but say they enjoyed it more than civil war. i can't say anything there as i haven't seen civil war, but i still really enjoyed it. it's very true to the lore, with only a handful of minor changes and maybe one moment where i went \"waaaaiiit a second, i don't think that's accurate\". the cgi was amazing, the soundtrack was fantastic, and the acting was good all-around. the magic was also really cool and felt very accurate to the warcraft universe. some of my favorite parts were just the interactions between durtan and drakka and durotan and ogrim. for cgi orcs, they had fantastic chemistry and were very believable. my only real complaints: lothar makes a few too many quips. he was obviously meant to be a joking and sarcastic character, but there was a point where it got to be a little too much, imo. the first 20 minutes is a big info-dump. for newcomers, this might be a little much to take in. it's a lot like watching the first episode of game of thrones where it's attempting to introduce you to every character and land and explain their motivations and who they are. some characters didn't get a chance to be fleshed out and developed. king llane was kind of just there for the most part, he never really got any story or development for himself. but i can sort of forgive this because the main focus characters like khadgar, medivh, the various orcs, etc. were all the most entertaining and got a fair bit of development. so, if you enjoy the warcraft series, you'll probably enjoy this. if you enjoy fantasy in general, you'll also probably enjoy this. honestly, i'd say to go see this movie if just to support more high- budget game films. don't listen to

certain points that need to be improved. duncan jones undoubtedly stayed faithful to the roots and his commitment, passion towards this universe can be felt in every scene. although i have spent thousands of hours in this world, i know very less about warcraft's history. so, it's a good thing that despite my lack of knowledge, i could easily catch up with the events and even keeping each name in mind wasn't a big deal either. the basic storyline serves as a perfect beginning for the warcraft universe, and this movie might be the very first milestone, from which sequels can grow out and find their own places in this fantasy world. motion capture technology proved once again that it is able to produce real characters. each orc was incredibly detailed from head to toe. face, eyes, hair, even the smallest hair follicles on their shoulders looked beyond belief. gears on each side were unique and creatively devised as well, i liked the appearance of blackhand in particular, who was wearing spines with skulls attached to his shoulder. characters and relationships among them need some improvement. the undeveloped romance between lothar and garona was clearly one of the weakest point of this movie. it was built up poorly and the 180 degree turn came from nowhere. it was like: \"we don't trust each other. boom. we love each other\". where is transition? it didn't have an arch at all, and the chemistry between them stands on shaky ground too. warcraft obviously has a lot more unexploited resources that (with a good care) could be used to build up a complex and diversified fantasy world. despite some flaws and unnecessary moments warcraft lived up to my expectations and it could be the movie that makes us forget those committed crimes against gaming industry, which were delivered by uwe boll. i really root for this movie and hopefully - if the box office income will satisfy producers - it will get the chance to swing higher and reveal an universe that was destined to be explored.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i've gotta say this movie surprised me. despite me being a fan of the warcraft series i had mixed feelings about this movie especially when the first reviews started to spring up but thankfully i really enjoyed the film for what it was. it does have a few flaws mainly in the form of pacing issues but this doesn't mean it automatically becomes terrible which some people keep jumping to despite it also having a lot of redeeming factors. it seems that a lot of people want to bash and criticise the movie simply for what it is, an extremely nerdy and often joked about source material trying to be brought into the world of franchises, yet people seem to forget that this is exactly what happened to comic books. now i'm not saying warcraft is as good as the first x-men or iron man but as a franchise starter it managed to be well contained story in its own right while still introducing us to the world of azeroth and the later stories that can (and possibly will) be told in that world. due to sheer size of the world and lore of the source material it's understandable why warcraft didn't achieve the absolute perfect balance that things like x-men did, but i personally believe duncan jones did the best he could while still staying as true to the original as possible. so yes it can be argued that the film is just to set up other movies but there are plenty of films that were essentially that to begin with and have had extremely successful franchises, hunger games and the divergent series all started off this way and i believe that warcraft is a much stronger starting movie than the movies that kick started those franchises. even this year batman vs superman was essentially a set up for the larger dc universe but was mishandled greatly, whereas warcraft feels more like it's trying to be a stand alone film and while it doesn't entirely achieve this it still holds up. as i said the film does suffer from pacing issues and this it's most glaring problem, i would be lying if i said it didn't take some enjoyment away from the film (one scene in particular comes completely out of nowhere and i still can't really understand it even now) but this is really the only huge flaw. something to mention is the world of azeroth is drenched in fantasy and unlike much more grounded versions of fantasy worlds such as game of thrones the sheer detachment from reality will turn some people off. this is by no means a bad thing about the movie and anyone who believes this to be a flaw (which some people do) should not be allowed to write movie reviews. it is simply a matter of personal opinion, if you enjoy that kind of thing then you will enjoy the film but if you're not really a fan of that sort of thing then warcraft isn't for you. now moving on to the good parts of the film, of which there are many. by far the strongest point of the movie is the acting, every character was 100% believable and when the characters are as outlandish as these ones this is not an easy thing to achieve. the good guys all felt as though they truly had something worth fighting for and everyone of them felt innately human (even the orcs) they had personalities, they had struggles and worries and things that made them happy, they had people they cared about, people they hated and all felt very natural to watch on screen, toby kebbell particularly stands out as durotan. villains were scary and ruthless and you just couldn't help but hate them for what they were but still love it when the come on screen just because they are so evil. speaking of the orcs, the cgi is damn near perfect as well, in fact i would go as far to say it was jurrassic park level of good, possibly better. the orcs all look like they are actually the hulking great beasts that they are and the level of detail put into them is incredible, so good you can see the hair follicles on the orcs arms. everything just feels real which again is no easy task considering the source material. the story is simple enough that everyone can follow it but not so simple it becomes boring or tedious. action scenes are stunning, dialogue is interesting and overall the pacing issues don't hinder the story too much, it just makes some scenes either pointless or rushed, but as said before it does not ruin the film by any means. in the end warcraft: the beginning isn't a perfect movie but it sure is a good one and is extremely enjoyable one at that, think along the lines of pacific rim but with a fantasy story and better acting. if you're a fan of the warcraft series you'll definitely enjoy it and even if you're not i recommend you check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised. this franchise has lot of potential so don't let a good movie or a possibly good franchise go to waste because of what it is or because it's not the masterpiece critics expect it to be. grab some friends, enjoy a fantasy a movie and just have fun with

{"text": "as a blizzard hc fan and player of all games (literally all), plus a big fan of their books and lore across all universes, i found this movie excellent! a more than enough earned 9/10 and this 1 point lower score is because there are multiple story deviations that i personally didn't enjoy because i like the original more. this is super cool positive attitude is expected from a hc fan, but with me there were two novices (know some points in the story trough the game) and three people that had no idea what it was about. and they loved the movie, and the most disturbing fact it they loved it a bit more than i did, as i was rewinding the movie and drawing a parallel with the original story. the cgi was superb and the fight scenes where top notch. story is a bit more shallow than i expected but after the movie, as i explained the general story line to non blizzard guys they felt so confused. i guess this was the best they could fit into 2h (which is very low for this movie) and i can't wait to see the 40mins extended version. if you are looking for a good fantasy movie please give this one a shot and let us blizzard fans pray they'll do more :)", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i loved this film, the cgi was brilliant, the locations and set were extraordinary, the acting was amazing, the costumes and make up were absolutely astonishing. duncan jones seriously kept true to the lore, truer than all game to film movies out there. people who have never seen the film before are noting this film as the new lord of the rings, and you know what, i believe them. there's so many negative critiques on this and coincidentally they're by people who have never played any of the games or read any of the novels. which is why i made an account specifically to say this; warcraft does not deserve the negativity and the low ratings (especially on rotten tomatoes), it's absolutely breathe-taking and i loved every minute of it. the reason for 9 out of 10 is because i agree with the statement that characters should have been developed more for people who have never heard of them prior to the movie. but for a girl who's been in love with world of warcraft since she was 10, this movie was something i'm very, very proud to witness.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i write this articles as a huge fan of the warcraft lore, i have read all books and short stories,

warcraft fans a better view..for example how ruthless guldan is. but i quite can't understand why the negative reviews keep pushing the movie down, it is an fantastic fantasy movies with awesome special effects a good story and awesome actor skills (medivh was great) if you hate warcraft don't watch it and rate the movie bad, you just destroy the enjoyment for others, who hope for a second

immersive they should have let the characters roam around the cities more. i wish they did because the details looked amazing. i actually re watched it and the humans (in my opinion not as relatable as the orcs) even grew on me. after re watching it again i really wanted it to be longer. it's good and fun. needs to be longer though. the world is vast the characters interesting. they should've taken advantage of it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i've just emerged from the midnight release of warcraft in the uk and i felt that this movie needs a review from an honest wow player. i will be blunt and simple. this movie is great for any wow players or general blizzard fans out there; the aesthetic and corresponding cgi are excellent and on-par if not better than expansion cinematics. the main soundtrack theme for this film is different to what you expect but fits well, i hope to download it when possible. what surprised me the most was that i actually enjoyed ben schnetzer's khadgar, and if i'm brutally honest, i think he was the best part of the film. so now, the dreaded flaws... - pacing: this film is all over the place, scenes are either too short or too long and not enough time is spent in each location (the world created was beautiful beyond belief) - unnecessary plot points: without going into too much detail, the film presents many \"emotional\" moments which are both unexpected to viewers and also failing completely to be pulled off by the director. i think that the film could have been without them and it would have flowed much smoother as well. - changes to warcraft lore: in short, there's a few small changes to the lore in regard to how certain moments play out, but the result is still the same. i can't say that i personally like the changes at all. smaller issues: - young varian looks like a girl - much of the \"humour\" added in to humanise the characters (both orc and human) feels very cringe-worthy - travis fimmel wasn't good as anduin lothar and honestly i don't think he's a good actor in my opinion. - ryan robbins' character \"karos\" was underused and his trailer scenes weren't in the movie - romance: anduin and garona's romance is incredibly unnecessary and awkward. (this was in the trailer so don't call me out for spoilers) to summarise, \"warcraft\" is a very enjoyable film but with a great number of flaws which, to be frank, distracted me at multiple times. i will say that it is not a bad video game movie, and deserves a sequel so to improve upon the mistakes it made. go see this film, it's worth the money.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "when i first heard that duncan jones was doing the movie i was pretty convinced it would be a good one. later, when the release came closer, i started to hear about the bad response critics gave it. at that point i started to doubt the movie but decided to watch it anyway... and the doubt is no more! it's tense, good-looking and more grim than i expected! sure, at times it's kinda cringy because of the high fantasy-style it's made in. the humans armor and so on. but considering it's based on a game, its understandable. it's not lords of the ring-good. but still a great movie! i really hope for a sequel.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i want to share you my feelings about this movie without spoilers. why ? because i saw the notes from metacritics and rt. to be honest, i must bring justice for this movie, because i can assure you this : warcraft movie deserves a chance and a shot from you guys. if you like the warcraft universe, please, go watch this movie, give it a chance, it deserves it ! if you are not a fan, go take a shot ! you will understand without problems. at the moment, it's the best movie based on video games (by far) and it didn't suck !! the trailers were really bad. if you like the warcraft universe and you are not reluctant about some changes in the lore (some are better), well you will enjoy the movie. let's talk about the movie. it's been since warcraft 3 i wait a warcraft movie. since warcraft 3, i'm a fan of this universe, the lore and the ambiance. the movie respect very well those 3 aspects. you are feeling you are in azeroth ! in general, i liked the movie. even if it's far from perfect and they made some changes from the lore (some are better, some are worst). but it's really feel like a true movie and not like a cinematic, or a movie with only fan service (like mortal kombat...) the movie respects well the main story and the universe of warcraft. the cgi is really great and make you enter in the movie ! i generally don't like the cgi, but this one is great, even if it has some weird and bad cgi rarely. the armor and weapons feel less plastic than in the trailers, but still a little bit. about the actors and the characters : - lothar (travis) is for me, the only character who doesn't feel like \u00ab feudal \u00bb. all the characters are, except him. he is a great actor, and unique don't get me wrong. but i didn't feel like a true commander of a human army in a feudal universe. he acts more like his character ragnar in viking, like an actual person on our world (with funny jokes). - khadgar is good. it is really the young apprentice who is a geek tand who is in search of the knowledge and want to learn the truth of medivh. pretty good (even with his pedo mustache). probably my third favourite character of the movie (its between him and durotan for the third place). - medhiv was my favorite character. he is very good powerful and mysterious at the same time, such as should being medivh! the only disappointment was that the movie did not enough develop his \"twist\" (if you are a fan of the lore, you know about what i speak). - king llane was .... ok. nothing transcendent. however, i loved his decision at the end of the movie. a good change from the original lore. great job duncan jones for this change ! - garona...believe me or not, she was for me the biggest surprise in term of actor's game and character development. yeah you heard this ! my mind was blown apart ! it is a really well realized character and paula patton really put a lot in this character ! her final twist is really great, even better than the original lore. my second favorite character of the movie! - for orcs, they are great in general except orgrimm who was a little bit disappointing, and blackhand at the end. for me the main issue i have with this movie was its duration. too short, way too short ! it's feeled a little rushed sometimes. it was really lacking one half an hour to develop certain moments and certain scenes. for example, we do not show enough that draenor is a dying world. other scenes were less good also. the changes on the lore are sometimes good (especially why garona makes \"this\" to king), others were less good. in term of fan service (the bad one), the movie only bring one fan service, which make it feel like a real movie. it was not only a movie made for fans and for the wrong reasons ! overall, i like this movie ! far from perfect, but still better than some marvel movies which are endless....it's a fresh, new and unique movie. if you are a fan of warcraft, don't listen rt and metacritics, go see and judge yourself !", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i don't know anything about world of warcraft but what i do know is that i love this movie!!

you can tell that they are setting up for future films by leaving story strands unresolved, which is becoming an annoying trend in block- buster movies. in this case though i really hope that the warcraft movie is a big enough success so that we can revisit this world and found out what happens to these characters next. 7/10.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "people are really slamming this down!

(i must say by the way the battles in this movie are quit epic!) the alliance wants to protect their homeland from the orcs and the orcs fights for survival. the only character that i really see as truly evil is gul'dan who i thought was a great villain. and the visual effects are mind blowing! ilm has done a fantastic job of making the cgi orcs realistic. the best cgi i have seen since avatars na'vi. and the movie might be more relevant than people would have thought. i am thinking especially about the refugee crises in europe and the migration to the us from mexico. people are desperate about a better life than what they had before. warcraft shows in some ways why some people suddenly decides to flee their homeland and travel to an unknown world. but i have to put out some things i did not like about this movie. the actors are ok but no one really stood out as great. i liked ben foster as medivh, toby kebbell as durotan and daniel wu as gul'dan. i thought they were the best actors. the rest was ok. a little disappointed about travis fimmel which i think acts better in vikings than he did in this movie. the problem is probably because many have mostly starred in television series. and the editing is bad in some parts of the film. it jumps sometimes too quickly between characters so that you easily get lost in what is happening with one character when they cut to another one. i was hoping for the same type of epic music like lord of the rings. that is type of music you could listen to and you do not need to watch to movie also. but here none of the music is really memorable. ramin djawadi, the guy that made the music for game of thrones (which has a lot of great music) disappoints here. i thought the only good part of the music was the theme for the orcs. i would have also liked if the movie showed a map of azeroth and draenor at the start of the movie so you get to know from the start how the worlds looks like. i am thinking mostly about people that do not know anything about warcraft. they show a map of azeroth one time in stormwind but i would have liked to see one from the start also. in a similar way like the prologue in lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring where you get to see a map of middle earth to introduce the world. i think some people would also find the magic silly, but i actually liked how they did it in the movie. it is a fantasy film after all. if people feel that they did not get to know the orcs in this movie i would recommend reading the book warcraft: durotan: the official movie prequel. the book is a prequel to the movie and you get to know durotan, draka, orgrim and the rest of the frostwolf clan a lot better. the book ends right before the movie starts. i felt if you have not read the book the movie does a poor job of introducing who they are and showing their way of life. and the book also ends right before the movie starts. the movie is not as good as lord of the rings and game of thrones, but it stand on its own as a good fantasy film. and there are a lot of easter eggs for the fans of the games. i think mostly people that are fans of the games will like it, but i thought duncan jones managed to make it so people that knows nothing of the warcraft games and world would enjoy it too. looking forward to a sequel to this movie if this one is a success and hopefully the next one can improve the mistakes of this one.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "wow. the people who made the trailers for \"warcraft: the beginning\" need to be fired because those don't do this movie justice at all, which comes from the utterly out of context cutting in them. i was so scared ... how bad will this be?

scenes like in hobbit movies. all my friends loved the movie. i've seen many fan reviews - on rt fan's gave warcraft 81%, on one polish movie page it's 7,6/10 and on the theaters's website it has 9.2/10. people love this movie and i recommend the critics to change their perspective.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "considering the reviews warcraft: the beginning has received and the general consensus of thinking that video game based movie aren't very good, i was fully expecting to see some what of a cinematic pan cake. surprisingly enough, warcraft works pretty well. it's no lotr mind you, but it is relatively entertaining, at places a bit cheesy, fantasy flick with pretty good special effects. warcraft is at its best when it revolves around the orcs. the humans are really the weak link of the whole thing, as very few of the actors chosen feel that they don't fit in a fantasy setting like this. a finnish director markku p\u00f6l\u00f6nen said once, that some people have epoch faces and some do not. by that he meant, that certain people suit better on a movie set in the past (or in a fantasy world), where as some just look too modern. most of the human actors here feel a bit too modern for the setting. also the writing on the humans side feels more rushed. but the orcs. now they're fantastic. they're gigantic beast, with tusks and huge weapons in their hands, riding on over sized wolves (or wargs, i'm not really sure, as i'm not huge warcraft guy). the orcs themselves aren't really evil at all, they're just misguided by the fell magic using gul'dan. in any case, the movie just seems to work better every time there's orcs on scree, be it durotan, garona or gul'dan. the pacing of the story is also a one big issue. it's easy to see, that there's a lot of story material been cut out from the movie and that really feels like it's hurting the overall experience. some additional material might even make the humans feel more compelling as well, but now there's no real connection to them here, as the story keeps jumping quite a bit. anyhow, warcraft really isn't even half as bad some sources have touted it as. it's relatively easy to follow for even a person like me, who played the original rts game years ago and has only skimmed wow briefly before getting bored with it. at times it did feel like it expected me to be more familiar with the franchise than i am, but in all it still is fun.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i just saw warcraft and i must say that it is suitable for all. no matter if you have played its game or not. it is suitable to you

warcraft experience. who would like this movie: lord of rings fans, harry potter maybe, any action science fiction movie or fight movie will like this too. the effects and are amazing. the main orc monsters are 'beautifully' ugly and the villain is pretty cool and terrible. the action sequences are awesome and i'm no fan of imax 3d but some sequences felt like i was sitting on the battlefield. i was really impressed. it looked way worst in previews. did i get the characters backgrounds, towns or fanfare? nope but that doesn't distract from enjoying the film. what distracts from the film is the actual production. they obviously clipped this down and left out linking scenes that are very apparent as things just literally jump from scene and place to place with no transition. it's pretty horrendous and apparent but doesn't make it any less fun when things get intense. ok now for the negatives that in no way should hinder you from seeing it just make it from a film and movie piece itself have some glaring issues. the transitions from scene to scene are so sporadic, so quick and non-smooth it is literally like watching an animated jr high powerpoint presentation with the \"slide\" transition used in overboard during scene changes. then the next scene will have no intro or background just through you into a non set up convo or action sequence. also the human support cast (other than main people) aren't in the same league and feel like children movie actors. they have potential but yeah. however those things don't make this movie unseeable just make this a bad

photo-realistic cartoon. you know you are looking at a fantasy creature but the detail of the skin, hair and movement tell you otherwise. the scenery is breathtaking, trees greener than any you've

cities don't look like real cities. i'm sorry but isn't a fantasy film meant to be about a fantasy place, involving fantasy characters? speaking of characters, there are plenty which leads me to my only gripe with this film ... expositions. the reality of bringing a world this big and complicated to a new audience is that you only have few hours to introduce, explain and build on each character. this lead to, at times, heavy clunky moments of exposition. my name is x, this is my personal history aaaaand moving on. but and this is a big 'but', the performances given by the actors were incredible, they had so little time to get you invested in them but they really managed to do it. the fight scenes are great despite being mostly computerized. you feel the impacts, you squirm at blows, it all seems to connect in a very real and visceral way. hats of to all who created this film, this could have been a major flop. i mean it really could have been crap, they could have skimped on effects, got the wrong actors for the roles, it could have been a quick cash grab and advert for the game. instead however we get a film that is clearly full of passion and heart and absolutely

some similarities to that trilogy, i wanted to clarify my opinion to this. for me warcraft isn't that boring and protracted ;). it has more action sequences and i really liked the cgi in that. what i should also mention is that the choice of casting travis fimmel was a fabulous idea, because for me without him this movie would be only average. i admire directors who don't cast the wannabe a-list

beginning the film to end that bad streak? sadly not as the film has been panned by critics and doesn't get a particularly good review right here either. the visual effects in this film are ok. the cgi looks very similar to blizzard's cinematic adverts for the world of warcraft games. the effects are a focus for this film as the fantasy genre demands lots of practical and visual effects for it to work. although impressing in some shots, the special effects look really fake in other scenes, taking the wow factor out of the world of warcraft. the acting is fairly poor. travis fimmel's, paula patton's, domonic cooper's and ben foster's performances bring nothing good to the film and their characters are ultimately uninteresting. the film also brings in some kind of young mage who i think is only there to explain to the other characters and the audience whats going on, both in technical jargon followed by layman's terms. the lack of care i felt towards the films characters is not solely down to the acting as the script doesn't help them much either, not really giving the actors much to work with to some extent. there were attempts to bring a personal touch to these characters such as lothar's son and garona's backstory told at a fire place, but these are a too brief to bring any real impact. the films plot to me felt like you needed to have some knowledge of the realm of azeroth to which the film is set. being a noob of the wow world i only understood the plot at its most basic level. the orc's ruthless dictator steals the souls of people as a source of energy to open up a portal so the orcs can take over the human world. then generic heroic man leads humans to stop this threat. this feels like a movie made for the fans of the game which it should be. so for fans of the wow games this is a must see but for novices like myself, maybe not. overall, warcraft is an ok movie but is one that you should go in with some knowledge of the game if you want to understand the film better. this is sadly not the film to break the video game to movie adaptation curse. hopefully the assassin's creed movie fairs better. fingers crossed because i love me some assassin's creed.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "warcraft: the beginning is directed and co-written by duncan jones. it stars travis fimmel, toby kebbell, ben foster and paula patton what's it all about then? the peaceful realm of azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another. as a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. from opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home. what are my thoughts? serving very much as a passion project for duncan jones who is widely known as a huge fan of the source material, warcraft serves as the british director's third feature length movie, with moon (2009) and source code (2011) proceeding this movie. warcraft also hopes to end the nearly twenty year running streak of by-and-large horrendous video game adaptations. therefore the movie-going public is looking to either this or assassin's creed (december) to wipe the slate clean. warcraft as an ip has an immense worldwide following of millions, i have never played the game and know nothing about the mythology, so i was going in as a \"newbie\". as a result i felt a little bit short changed, i wouldn't say i was baffled by the proceedings, knowing the above premise is pretty much all i needed to know, what's more being a huge fan of peter jackson's middle earth masterpiece trilogy certainly stood me in good stead. however, the lord of the rings though - this is not, it really tries hard to be and each scene by jones is lovingly crafted but it just does not resonate on anywhere near the same level. visually though, warcraft is impressive, and at times stunning. no more so than the mo cap work of toby kebbell as duratan (my favourite character). we really are starting to enter a new era as regards what can be achieved on screen. the humans are a mixed bag, travis fimmel as lothar, warcraft's answer to aragorn and ben schnetzer as a trainee wizard are probably my favourite. they at least go some way to offer levity in what is at times given some plot twists a pretty grim movie. paula patton as garona is good as well. ben foster is miscast though, as medivh the protector of azeroth, they needed a much older actor to pull off the gandalf-esque part. finally, dominic cooper of all people phones in a wooden performance as azeroth's king. the story and dialogue is without question the achilles heel of the movie. it seems to cram a huge amount of protagonists and story strands into a fleeting two hours. it clearly places itself as a franchise set up movie, but let's hope, (given the general reaction thus far to the movie) jones gets a chance to tell us the middle and end. when you have been spoilt on an amazing trilogy such as the lord of the rings which is based on a critically acclaimed and beloved book, any movie maker that dare set foot on even similar ground does so at his own risk. if you are a fan of the game, you will of course no doubt appreciate the movie on a completely different level as i hear there are easter eggs galore for those who know where to look. so after all this does it wipe the slate clean? based on the movie itself, no but given the passion behind the camera i would say at least the director of this movie cared about the source material, and tried his best and for that yes it does. let's just hope therefore that if the studio green lights any subsequent instalments, the story is on par with the visuals. personally though, i would say that if you are a fan of the game check it out, but if you are new to this world such as i, then just stay at home and watch the lord of the rings - the real thing.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "this is a film that i had highly anticipated since its first trailer was released; not because i'm a big warcraft fan (never played the game) but because duncan jones has a nasty habit of making great films. moon was an intriguing watch with plenty of nods to kubrick and source code was an extremely entertaining sci-fi/action tale, so what's the worst that could happen?... warcraft is the answer you were looking for. warcraft is an abysmal attempt at storytelling and it seems that the only thing the film sets out to achieve (and does so successfully) is setting up a sequel. the film can be forgiven for the cgi-fest that it is, it's based on a game and the scale that the film is operating on likely lends itself more to the green screen. however what it can't be forgiven for is a script that seems like its right out of some poor sod's fan fiction. there are lines in this film that are hard to believe got past the first draft let alone made it to the big screen, the 'no he's not/yes he is' argument between lothar and garona was head-in-hands embarrassing. it's difficult to blame the actors for simply going through the motions when the material they had to work with was p*ss-poor... but not that difficult. the acting was reminiscent of a back-alley stage production and made me want to disassociate with any humans on screen in favour for their orc counterparts. it's hard to believe that there was more life to be found in the motion-captured orcs than in any human equivalent but beggars can't be choosers. the one major positive that comes from this film is that duncan jones proves that it is possible to translate games to the big screen. there is a tangible sense that you are watching a game, from the camera angles that are evocative of cut-scenes during game play to the shallow dialogue and convenient plot points, it's unsurprising that many hardcore warcraft fans enjoy this film. the problem is that where this should have been a film about a game and it became a film of a game. it's all too similar to sitting down at a friend's house and watching him play a game for two hours, the fun's going to dry up after about 30 minutes and this is exactly what happened here. i would only recommend this to those that are fans of the source material... and perhaps not a fan of film", "class":

avoid this film at all cost. so, let just pinpoint the proof that this film deserves its 22% on rotten tomatoes. firstly, the film does its story-boarders at blizzard gaming zero justice here. what gamer friends have hailed as one of the best story lines in modern gaming (*now i seriously doubt its validity) prove nothing more than a basic war and politics flicks that confuses. moreover, the plot seem to consistently be iconic movie sequences pieced together haphazardly. in all fairness, the film's writers tried to create character arcs around several main characters, but many of these were poorly executed to the point that plot holes became unnecessarily obvious. secondly, casting felt like a huge mismatch. humans interacting with orcs in the film felt more like ugly overgrown neanderthals speaking to the modern men of evolution. fight sequences felt dry and predictable largely thanks to lacking realism in the voice acting. this was of course made worse by the fact that i became bored to death that all those droning of \"history\". for me, it was bizarre since legendary pictures is known for casting lesser known stars in lead roles that thrust them into the spotlight. (don't believe me? look at christian bale in the dark knight trilogy, henry cavill in superman's remakes and chris pratt in jurassic world) that said, there is one tiny salvaging moment for this film and that's the cgi war scenes. the zoomed out camera pans reminded me of some of the gaming footage i've watched off global wow competition and therefore looks awesome on the big screen. quite

as a twitchy junkie with a lot of sass, rather than a stern and battle-hardened warrior. no matter what line he was delivering, he would get crazy eyes and start weaving his head around, kind of like a ghetto chick ready to throw down with another ghetto chick. ben schnetzer as khadgar looks like he just got hazed at his local fraternity, and needs to shave that pathetic pedo-stache immediately.

the hero and his nemesis? forget imaginative choreography, let's just repeat the fight between johnny cage and goro, because people loved that movie right? i think there were actually two brief moments that surprised me, a total of about 2 minutes in the 2 hour run time. for the rest of the 118 minutes, it was tedious and predictable. speaking of choreography, while the fight scenes look impressive, there is nothing happening in them. there is no ingenuity, no creativity, nothing. when it comes time for a powerful warlock to fight an orc chieftain, they just thrown down fists. i understand it's tradition, but the warlock never shows off any other skills besides \"drain life.\" gul'dan is the casul player who spams a single attack because they're braindead. what happened to shadowbolt, dots, or summons? mages are either shooting blue balls, surrounding themselves in blue balls, or teleporting in a blue ball. what happened to blink, fire and ice spells? the magic is the most unimaginative part of this entire movie, which is an absolute shame since it could have been a real strong point. the only good thing this movie has going for it is looks. it looks good, the motion capture is great, and it doesn't have a washed out monochrome color scheme like most blockbusters these days. i appreciate the aesthetics of the armor and locations, geography, and creatures, but without any emotion or soul behind all the pretty stuff, it just feels empty. this movie is like an empty suit of decorative armor on a pedestal, it serves no purpose but to look nice.", "class":

bizarre names of characters in this movie (i'm one of those). special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. the weakest part of this movie for me was travis fimmel acting. that has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. they need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. and sorry paula patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. the story was quite ok - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. as not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some ok flick on friday evening, \"warcraft\" is for you, but don't expect to be blown away. overall, \"warcraft\" is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. performances were between low and ok - better cast highly recommended for sequels (altough there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). \"warcraft\" is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. so - it's a ok flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "first off, i'm going to address the reasons why people hate this movie. simply put, it throws you in the deep end of a complicated and involved mythos and expects you to either go with it, or gtfo. there is precious little in the way of explanation of who the characters are, why they have the motivations they do, or how they all interact with one another. in short, if you know something of the lore around the warcraft game, you'll be a lot happier than someone who knows nothing. most of the negative reviews seem to come from the latter camp of people, and for that, i can, for once, hardly blame them. after all, plenty of people who had never read the lord of the rings enjoyed the movies of that franchise without any prior knowledge of tolkien's world. so in essence, what i am saying is that warcraft does a poor job of explaining its world an people. that said, i think this was always going to be a film that would be appreciated more by the fans of the games. i include myself in this group and i can honestly say i found it enjoyable. the bright colours and larger than life characters may not be for everyone, but for game fans, there is little to complain about. characterisation is a bit thin. again, the movie expects you to know a little about the players in its universe before going into it. it is effectively hoping the game has done all that pesky familiarisation for you, allowing you to just enjoy the plot. as for the plot... well, it details the arrival of the orcs into azeroth and the ensuing conflict that arises with the existing races. the orcs are somewhat huge in comparison to the humans and the action does a good job of getting that strength across visually. effects-wise it is something of a hit-and-miss affair, with some of the facial cgi being amazing and some of the mass battle effects looking weak. likewise, the sorcery and magic effects are very well done. overall, however, there is nothing too bad to complain about, and the balance is definitely on the positive side. dialogue is at times decent, occasionally laughable and sometimes dire. no one will win any awards for this but there are enough moments of genuine humour amongst the verbal clangers that it somehow manages to overcome the writing deficiencies and veer into cheesy-goodness as opposed to direness. so what you have is an action-fantasy story with a deep background that most average folks will never understand, coupled to thinly developed characters and a plot of world domination that wouldn't be amiss in a 30's serial. yet, somehow it manages to work. maybe it is because i have that background knowledge, or maybe duncan jones has managed to make the impossible work, but warcraft is an entertaining movie to watch. it won't win any awards, as i already said, but it kept me watching to the end, which makes no sense when i consider all of the component parts individually. but as a whole, it is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. is it worth your time? well that depends on whether you are a fan of the games or fantasy in general. if yes, then i'd say give it a go, and ignore all the critical reviews that slam it. make your own mind up. if you are not such a fan, you might find it confusing and simplistic and not very satisfying. summary: mostly for warcraft fans. lots of weak points, but yet manages to work in spite of this. if they make a sequel, i'll go see it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "so, it is easy to dismiss warcraft - the beginning as a campy, convoluted fantasy movie. but if you take a closer look, you can clearly see duncan jones' handwriting. the way, this movie deals with topics of identity, relationship and finding your place in the world, lifts it above average. i have very little knowledge about the lore of warcraft. actually, all i know about it comes from playing the related hearthstone card game. compared to the huge behemoth, warcraft is, i think, it's safe to say, that i know nothing about it. and yes, i often felt completely lost in the packed story line of this movie. you could see the director struggling with at least a dozen major characters, trying to give everyone enough screen time and something meaningful to do. to my surprise, this worked much better, than it could have. but still, i often found myself asking: what on azeroth is going on here? what kept me in this movie was the way, jones' managed to give the story arc a greater meaning. there were interesting things about different family types and how to live with them in it. there was the wechselbalg, raised by people who would be their enemies. there was the average family with parents who cared about their newborn, just trying to live a normal, peaceful life as everyone does (and how great, that we find this type of family amongst the orc, who are supposed to be the villains). there was the widowed father, trying to be a good dad, despite blaming his son for the mother's death. jones has dealt with identity, the question, what makes a person a person and stuff like that in his previous movies. so it absolutely makes sense, that he picks up on that in this movie as well. he also manages to have strong female characters and even passes the bechdel test, who would have thought that!? this movie has flaws aplenty. but there is also a lot of interesting stuff in it and it's definitely one of the better computer game adaptations.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "it's the best video game adaptation ever made! although, let's face it, this is faint praise. more importantly \u0096 and i suspect this was director duncan jones's mission statement \u0096 it's a good film. not perfect, but better than the wham bam trailers would have us expect, and nothing like those rotten tomatoes numbers. most will have heard of world of warcraft, the western world's most successful massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. although jones's movie actually returns to 1994, to the original game, warcraft: orcs & humans, as its starting point. so, do i review this adaptation as a layman or a fan? i fall somewhere in-between: i've played warcraft 3 and vanilla wow, but then my knowledge falls away. still, i know a murloc warble when i hear it, and i understand the significance of the name durotan. durotan (toby kebbell) is an orc chief of the frostwolf clan. his homeworld draenor is dying, and his leader, gul'dan (daniel wu), is farming the souls of the indigenous draenei in order to create a portal to azeroth, where he intends to migrate his horde and settle in the new world. trouble is, azeroth is already home to humankind (and elves and other species we briefly glimpse). the human military force in azeroth is led by lothar (travis fimmel), a powerful warrior who joins forces with the mage named medivh (ben foster) and mage-apprentice khadgar (ben schnetzer) to fight the horde and close the portal. but durotan is equally sceptical about gul'dan's crusade, and he is seeking to halt the mighty warlock via orcish mutiny. when the humans capture the half- orc garona (paula patton), she becomes the bridge between lothar and durotan. but will it be enough to prevent gul'dan from completing his apocalyptic plan? the themes are broad and basic but laudable. displaced people from a dying land escaping to a new place and a new culture? there are obvious parallels with modern migration struggles. but jones targets a more nuanced dramatic core, focusing upon those individuals seeking common ground \u0096 who happen to be the proudest and arguably truest of each tribe. there's a hint of the hobbit in the bright-but-grounded style of the movie. but the similarity ends there, because while peter jackson stretched a lot of content thinly across nearly nine hours, jones and his co-writers pack more significant incident into two. i also feel that jones has done a better job of integrating practical sets and props with cg environments. the special effects are something special, particularly during the orc scenes. i haven't seen such weight and clarity in cgi since pacific rim. while warcraft doesn't seek to mimic the games' almost cartoony aesthetic it is evidently a work of great care and affection for the larger-than-life source material. on the performance front, fimmel essentially reprises his roguish vikings role as the charismatic lothar. patton's garona plays a key part as the go-between for the clashing factions. i especially enjoyed her non-nonsense attitude to mating. gul'dan is a wonderfully grotesque creation whose fel power has left him utterly indifferent to the plight of the common man. there's a fantastically 12a-pushing scene in which he idly sucks the soul from a human captive like he's toking on a crack pipe. but it's kebbell who steals the show. he lives and breathes the hulking durotan \u0096 with this role and apes' koba, i wonder if we have a successor to andy serkis in the motion capture maestro stakes. the focus on characters and by extension themes is what elevates warcraft above standard fantasy fare. even when, in the final battle, the intimate drama threatens to be swamped by spectacle, jones has the sense to give us emotional beats: pay-offs for the patient character-building of the first two acts. warcraft has been hugely underrated by professional critics so far. the temptation is to rally against this perceived injustice. but let's reach for some objectivity: warcraft is a flawed film. there's some seriously clunky dialogue, as per the need for exposition in a fantasy universe that will be all-new to many in the audience. and a sub- plot about lothar's son never really resonates, perhaps because there are so many characters vying for real estate in the relatively brief running time. warcraft's chief flaw may be its subtitle. it means we're left with a dangerously inconclusive ending. how much it's possible to enjoy the final act of this film depends largely on whether \"the beginning\" is suitably confident or hopelessly optimistic. knock off a star if your interest in warcraft doesn't extend beyond one particularly amusing south park episode \u0096 you're still in for a solid, enjoyable adventure story, somewhat old-fashioned in tone; and which also, in an era of turgid monstrosities, feels unusually brisk. for the fans, this is a no-brainer which happens to have some brains to go with its brawn.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "wow! i did not expect warcraft movie to be this spectacular. and i'm not a gamer nor have i ever even played warcraft games, so to

legendary pictures and universal pictures gave you this adventure saga based on blizzard entertainment's iconic property. directed by duncan jones who spent more than three years working on this project, the story is essentially about a peaceful realm that suddenly faces the fearsome orcs who have fled their dying home in search of a refuge. a portal connects these two worlds that ultimately collide in a massive war for the fate of their family, their people, and their home. i had my worries at first because i feared that since i didn't know much about warcraft universe and its mythology that the film would somehow lose me. but the writers including duncan jones came up with this heroic story with its many complications and all shades of grey, because the motivations on both sides can be justified depending on how you look at each of them, and it's so well-structured that anybody can follow it just fine; that they can invest themselves in it. and there's balance as well, you'd enjoy the orcs storyline just as much as you'd enjoy the human dramas. some can even draw israel - palestinian struggle comparison with this film, but that's another topic for another time. this year alone, just when you thought \"the jungle book\" had raised the bar in terms of visual effects, this warcraft movie comes along and splits us in half, basically. watching it in 3d even adds to its already many breathtaking, mind-blowing sequences. the world created, including the houses, the castles, the creatures, the designs are nothing short of astonishing, clearly this is the work of people

can empathize with. remember how critically acclaimed gollum from lord of the rings was and expand that to the entire race of orcs. 3. great, entertaining soundtrack. for the game of thrones fans, it's worth mentioning that this film has the same composer. 4. fast-paced, epic action. i know plenty of people who complained about the pacing of the hobbit trilogy; this is pretty much the opposite. not a minute passes without a battle, an awesome spell being cast, or another key event for the plot. 5. spectacular magic. this ties in to point 1, but i think it deserves its own mention. i have seen plenty of fantasy films, but never anything like this. cons: 1. the pace means you might lose track of the characters without prior knowledge. in my opinion, the movie should be at least 30 minutes longer. i will definitely see an extended cut if it's made available. 2. only for fans: there are some minor lore changes, but they mostly involve the way some characters are killed. the film sticks very well to the core elements of the lore. you should really go see this film; you won't regret either the money or the time investment. also, the source material becomes more complex,

friends at secondary school told me everything about the lore and since then we always talked about it. deathwing has always been my favourite character though, and if the studios are planning on

neat stuff and some bad stuff. the bad stuff i'll focus on first, mostly to do with the pacing. this movie is two and a half hours long and at a point, my friend's sister fell asleep almost half way through, mostly because it was rather a late screen timing that the film was on at. the pacing of this movie really dragged on, and i felt like the narrative was a little unfocused and the characters and lore of warcraft were both not given the proper development (unless this turns out to be the start of a series, perhaps trilogy, i hope it is so they can explain more). however, that's not to say that i didn't like the movie because of those things. i actually really liked this movie for the most part because it at least had enough interesting characters with deep emotion and amazing visual spectacle and epic gritty action sequences to the film a thrilling and enjoyable movie-going experience for me. the main villain, i thought was delivered great justice, the main orc character, durotan, i thought was hands down the best part of the movie as well as the main human character, lothar, who i really liked as well. daniel wu, toby kebbell and travis fimmel did a spectacular job and i was on board with their characters throughout the movie. the rest of the characters felt sort of bland to me, but i felt like they had some good story arcs there and interesting depth to them at

it to be successful and i believe the world created in the film can obviously be expanded upon and offer some truly great cinematic experiences. duncan jones, who gave us the brilliant moon and exciting source code is behind the camera and brings a wonderful visual style, but as is the case with a lot of big budget cgi filled epic flicks, the visual style is not enough. the orc world is dying and they need to find another to live. gul'dan unite the orc clans together to become the horde. he uses a magical power known as the fel to create a portal to another world, azeroth. the portal needs life to be sacrificed in order to work so thousands of people are captured in azeroth in an attempt to bring even more of the horde over to conquer the lands. sir anduin lothar, a military commander leads the humans in a fight to protect their land. along with their king, a magical being known as the guardian and a mage in training, they need to stop the portal from being built before it's too late. as basic as the premise sounds (evil invading / good defending) the film throws a lot at you in quick successions. i'd be lying if i said i didn't feel overwhelmed by it all. i've never played the games, so i'm sure i missed a lot of winks and nods and of course my enjoyment of it might be on the lesser side of things, but warcraft is exciting in many sequences. those exciting sequences astonish the eyes with dazzlingly effects. i doubt we'll see anything that looks better this year, the orcs feel alive. in particular durotan, an orc that believes his leader gul'dan is doing more damage than good. he is the one orc that is given something that resembles a backstory. his wife gives birth early in the film and i can only assume that the child goes on to become someone important in the game franchise. on the human side, lothar is the character that jones decides to focus on. he's a soldier, that's all he knows. he's even brought his son up to be soldier. his two duties in life are to protect his son and protect the king. with the invading armies of the horde, his skills and loyalty are put to the test. the king, basically does what a king does, order people to do this, order people to do that. we get little interaction with a more humanistic side to him. magic is also a big portion of the film, with a man known as the guardian who holds what seems to be unlimited power and a mage, who is still learning his spells. they fill their basic fantasy roles, but i can't help but feel that ben foster, who plays the guardian, is miscast. maybe it's his age, but i simply did not believe him in this film at all. warcraft is full on fantasy. giant birds, magical beings, kingdoms and castles. for those not interested in those things, warcraft will not convert you. in fact it will make you feel more alienated. what it does do, for me at least, is be interested in the possibility of a sequel. the film throws a few surprises at you and does a lot of set-up for those future instalments, which might not even come. as it stands, warcraft is a film to watch on a big screen, in high definition. i totally understand why the critics hate it, why the

entertaining! the acting on most parts was great imo, though i felt the weakest among the cast were ben schnetzer as khadgar, and maybe paula patton as garona. i've been a huge fan of travis fimmel since seeing him in vikings so i expected lothar to be my favourite character due to fanboyism, but i can honestly say that durotan was by far the best character! i feel durotan really carries the entire movie! as far as the main villain goes, i thought gul'dan was so cool! he was sinister and held a strong, intimidating presence early on! i'm in love with the soundtrack as well, ramin djawadi does a great job once again! overall i feel warcraft is a fun time for casual moviegoers, and there seems to be plenty of references etc. for fans of the games and novels. it has some issues and it's not perfect, but then no film really is. at the very least, you'll be getting some awesome fantasy action with breathtaking visuals! well worth the money in my opinion, and i'll definitely be buying

this game itself, etc. i evaluate and review this movie as a standalone movie itself, not based on how well or badly it follows the original game. you have a slow and boring weekend, and say to self what i can do to make it a little bit better? let's go and watch a movie! and you choose this movie based on the beautiful visuals and cgi scenes that you have seen in the trailer. and 30 minutes into the movie and you realize you could have more fun if you had staid at home and watch your favorite tv series from netflix again! this is pretty much what happened to me! i have to admit that cgi work was great. the orcs were designed and created very beautifully. it was fascinating to watch them. i won't be surprised if this movie wins awards for its visual effects. but the weak story line and character development let you down and ruins this beautiful visual effects for you. again, i am not a gamer and do not care what the original story line in the game was. what i can tell is that the story line was weak, and this story line was implemented even weaker! spoiler alert: ===== it seems that there was supposed to be a chemistry created between anduin lothar and garona. but the chemistry felt so forced. it never felt real or organic, we, the viewers, were just supposed to accept that yes, these two are now in some sort of love. i am not sure it was because of bad acting, bad directing, or bad story line and character development that the chemistry and love between them never felt real. garona was a captive, a prisoner. but all of sudden she became a right hand of king, who everyone trust and she started to ride along the king and roam around freely. when the guardian was weak and left on his bed to rest, the king had asked garona to stay by his bed and keep an eye on him. i mean come on, the guardian is arguably the most important figure in the kingdom to stand against the enemy and then you ask an alien who you captured awhile ago to take care of him? there is no one else in the kingdom to be with the guardian and to keep an eye on him? ben schnetzer played khadgar. but i never could accept him as a wizard, he struck me as stable boy in the kings castle, not a person who possesses special powers. i would blame this on 1- bad casting, 2- questionable acting,and 3- unsuitable makeup and hairstyle. he looked like a clueless chubby boy, not an intelligent, smart wizard! despite the fact that the special effects were great, but the production design for some locations were were armature and questionable. there was a scene that the king and his solders are leaving the capital o go for war, and they are marching through the city. it looked like that the city location and buildings were designed and created by cardboard. of course very few movies go to the extend of physically building real building and locations. however, the scene and houses shouldn't be this much obviously cheap! i was laughable. the movie looked good when you are watching the orcs and the cgi parts. but when it switches to humans, it falls flat. you could feel more connected with orcs than with the humans. end of spoiler =========== don't get me wrong. i do not expect a complex story line from a movie such as warcraft. i just need a simple, consistent, believe (based on the rules of the movie itself) story line. warcraft had the budget and potentials to be a nice popcorn movie. but there were multiple story line, acting and casting problems there were distracting you from relaxing and enjoying this summer action flick. the movie was a disappointment,

amputate limbs in punishment for infractions, just as happens daily in the jihadi third of the real world. orc factions constantly are in armed conflict with one another. sound familiar? of course it does, at least to them. the orc clans share a love for stone age rituals, and the destruction of any bulwarks of more advanced civilizations, just as the jihadis razed palmyra, ninevah, and blew up the planet's largest statues and other world wonders (not to mention the pride of japanese architecture, new york city's world trade center). orc warfare is often one-sided hands-on terror waged

honestly say that is better than avatar of dawn of the planet of the apes, but just like these two movies, it has it's cartoonish moments, but that didn't disturb me... next, the story's core, or the way the story would have looked like is very nice, simple, rehashed, but very nice introduced on screen. the fights were extraordinary, very well choreographed and very intense. the characters are very nice, especially durotan(who was my favourite), but it was hard for me at times to get familiar with so many names and characters, but they all fit in very good. the bad: there isn't any story to show us how the orcs world was dying, and maybe show some of gul'dan's fault. maybe a 5-10 minutes intro like lotr would have don it nicely. and that's why some people and the critics especially will find this movie bad for, the incomplete story, but that's not the big problem. for me the biggest problem is how durotan figures out that gul'dan was the problem for which their worlds were dying. it is literally a 3 minutes scene where something happens and then a cliff talk and that's how durotan figures it out. how i said earlier, it would have made sense a 5-10 minutes story of the orcs, that would hint some things pointing towards gul'dan's fault. the last problem is the lack of character development. the characters literally are shown in cut scenes just so the plot can go further, but there isn't really any development of them, maybe a longer runtime, and a more focused approach could have solved this. so is the video game to movie curse broken? in a way... but this movie has some aspects to improve upon, but what i enjoyed most about it was that it felt like lotr, a fantasy movie, and a welcome into a big universe of potentially great future movies. so, i rate this movie with seven, of course the critics can only see this movie for what it's not, but i found it to be very entertaining, didn't made me sleep(like ant-man did) so that's ok for me. it's worth it, and hope so

waiting to see if the movie warcraft (2016) leaves us all hanging like the last few expansions or if it was a good movie. i've been playing wow since vanilla and like all true warcraft fans have lost a lot of interest in the game since cataclysm, blizzard has burned us all with warlords of draenor, mist of pandaria, and contemplating if to waste time playing legion; the list just keeps going when it comes to the let downs we've endured being a warcraft fan but\u0085\u0085 the movie? to be honest warcraft (2016) really made me feel like playing again. over the passing few days a few of our guildies have started logging back in the game play to see if we want to play when legion arrives which we've all pre-order; though being that all of us have watched the film now\u0085.. i felt like we had just played the game again. warcraft (2016) took us on a journey in which every movement in the film reminded us of those quest lines. to see a realistic version of stormwind, the characters in the film looking so close to reality; this film was a marvelous reminder of the game we all fell in love with. the bonuses to watching the movie warcraft (2016) versus playing the game are you wont find any douche bags in chat or in a raid while you watch. also we noticed the difference between the film and the game are: in the movie you don't see naked men running around with swords. you don't see dead people being tea bagged by a bear tank. there's no chat screen of whining ass-hats bickering. you don't see groups of people dancing in the middle of stormwind that's just to name a few lol.

punisher_2004 and daniel wu-into the badlands_tv, the man with the iron fists. this movie is based on a video game and as i have mentioned on numerous occasions before, i do not play video games. i have nothing against them, i just never had the spare time to play them, what with other interests taking up my time-which i'm sure some people would think were just as absurd time wasters as anything else that people occupy their time with, but i digress........ i can tell you about the movie, though. there are humans living in a kingdom called azeroth and they are ruled by dominic/king wrynn. there are other types of species surrounding them, including elves and human-looking sparkly eyed creatures. travis/lothar is dominic's brother-in-law and also toughest knight-in his spare time, he flies around on a bird/horse type of animal that also can handle himself in a fight. then there are the orcs. they are bigger than their human counterparts-and they have tusks-and they come from another planet-which is dying, by the way-through a magic portal created by daniel/gul'dan to colonize our planet as their new home. daniel uses the life force of other orcs or humans as fuel for his magic. ben/medivh is dominic's sorcerer that comes from a group of sorcerers that try to maintain order. paula/garona is a half orc half human hybrid-i don't think they ever mention her back story, of how she became a half breed but i'm sure fans of the video game will know it. the motion capture characters and all the other cgi effects look really good and the battles are pretty fantastic. wait until you see an orc pick up a horse and throw it, knocking down opponents like bowling pins! the movie ends as if there will be more sequels, depending on box office, of course. it's rated \"pg-13\"

of the first meeting between orcs and humans on the fantasy world azeroth. this film has 2 main stories which i will talk about separately as each has their own positive and negatives. these stories do intertwine with each other, but that happens far into the movie. we begin with the orcs. we follow durotan (played by toby kebbell), who is the leader of the frostwolf clan (one of many clans of orcs living together). all he wants is the best for his clan, and he doesn't trust gul'dan (excellently played by daniel wu, he looks and acts exactly the same in the game), who is a powerful but evil warlock. this eventually leads to durotan trying to contact the humans for help. first of all, the motion capture for the orcs is excellent. at some points they even looked more real than the humans, if that makes sense. this was portrayed excellently in a shot at the beginning of the film, where durotan is just looking towards the camera for an uninterrupted 10 seconds. his face moves just like a real face, and the way his expressions change is incredibly realistic. i was worried before i saw this movie as i thought cgi orcs interacting with real humans would look odd, like in the hobbit trilogy. i am glad to say this wasn't the case, and it worked extremely well. the only orc i didn't like was garona, who is half orc and half draenei (other reviews i have been reading keep saying she is half human, the film never states this so i'm not sure where they're getting that from). she isn't motion captured, which i thought was strange because all the other orcs, dwarfs and night elfs were. her performance was pretty weak, which is a shame, as i wanted to care about her character, but i didn't. i also liked the relationships between the orcs. they're not the bumbling idiots like they are portrayed in other fantasy licenses like warhammer or lotr. they actually have intellectual conversations with one another. i especially liked the scenes between durotan and his wife, where they were discussing their worries about having a child. this is where duncan jones shines through, as his other films have been almost entirely character driven. many were worried that a project as big as this wouldn't be possible for a director like duncan, this isn't the case though and fans of both high octane fight scenes and insightful character interactions will be pleased. the orc combat in this film is absolutely fantastic. the brutality of the orcs as they fought against each other was incredible. the same cannot be said about human/orc combat, but the orcs look real and fight like actual living breathing creatures. there's a fight scene with gul'dan near the end that i won't spoil, but it is amazing and will have you gripped in your seat. the human story on the other hand is a mixed bag. we follow anduin lothar(played by travis fimmel) , a strong fighter who is trying to defend azeroth from the orcs. we also follow a mage called callan (played by burkely duffield), who is presented as an awkward, wimpy type character. there are many other characters i am not mentioning, but i'm not here to do a plot synopsis. the humans look like they're ripped straight from the game which is brilliant. they wear shiny armor with massive shoulder plates which gave me a grin. the mages are also extremely cool, with long robes and bright blue eyes. the special effects shine through here too, with the mage's spells looking amazing and feeling real within the world of the film. my main problem with the humans is that they're not explained enough. i didn't feel for any of the characters, unlike the orcs, who showed a surprising amount of emotion. a certain character died and i should have felt bad, but i didn't. apparently 40 minutes have been cut from this movie, and it's obvious where things had been cut. i hope this cut gets released, if so i'll do another review. now i'll talk about other aspects of the overall movie. there are many easter eggs throughout the movie which any fan of the series will notice. my favorites being a polymorph and a murloc. these are thrown in throughout and will bring on a smile from any warcraft fan in the audience. the locations that are visited are all recognizable from the games, and seeing ironforge and stormwind on the big screen was great. other races are shown throughout the film, but they are only for a short while. i wish we had more scenes with the dwarfs or night elves, they could have even helped with the battle at the end which would have been enjoyable. but, i do understand that this is based on warcraft : orcs and humans, which was only about the orcs and humans. there are some differences made to the original story, but nothing was drastic and i didn't have a problem with them. warcraft : orcs and humans, what this film is based on. the pacing at the start of the film was a bit iffy, which is most likely because of the 40 minutes of deleted scenes. the film kept jumping around from place to place which would have been very confusing had i not been a warcraft fan. my partner who i saw this film with is not a fan, and she was also confused with the start of the film as the characters traveled to 4 or 5 different locations in 30 minutes. overall, i really enjoyed this film and i am extremely excited for further sequels. with a lore as vast as warcraft, they could make an entire film series out of it.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i have been excited for this film since the first trailer and even after the poor reviews i still was hyped for it and i really enjoyed this film. the premise of

makes you care about him. he has charisma to him and depth to his character as he tries to stop his world from being destroyed. tobby kebbell plays durotan, the main orc chief who wants to see his people to survive without war with the humans. i liked his character because he goes against the typical orc because you can tell that he has depth to his personality over just wanting war. ben foster plays the guardian of humanity and he does a great job, his character had awesome powers and his character developed throughout the film. paula patton plays garona and she really delivered a good performance from a character who really thrived in this film as more then just a simple romance. dominic cooper plays the king and even though he doesn't have loads to do i thought he did a pretty good job in this film. all the orc characters were interesting and it is done well enough to make you care about the orcs. the story has some decent drama to it on both sides that made both sides interesting and compelling. however, i would have liked to have seen more interaction between the two sides as at times it does feel like that the two stories are quite disconnected which hurts the overall story. the script has some great drama in it with the individual stories developing well. however, this film does lack any real humour in it which is disappointing for a film like this. the

"nobody seems to give a damn about the incredible amount of deviations from the original warcraft lore! spoilers!!!!! for crying out loud, they completely changed everything with garona, for the worse! she became a frustratingly compassionate goody two- shoes who kills her king not because she's being manipulated by the shadow council (which doesn't even exist in the film...) but because it was llane's request to do so, so that she becomes accepted by her people yada yada blablabla. this all happens in a battle at the dark portal.. sigh.. during which medivh is killed by being crushed by a clay golem. for crying out loud, is this a children's film? just let him get stabbed by lothar! and after the battle, anduin comes in on his gryphon to take llane's corpse from the battlefield, and he just lands there and takes the corpse while his gryphon is apparently powerful enough to hold off a thousand orcs. i wish my gryphon could do that. after that he fights blackhand in a mak'gora (dont forget, none of this actually happened - in the lore.) and literally just slices through his crotch and stabs him in the back like he's cutting through butter. with a cgi fancy butter knife. of course, in the lore, orgrim actually challenges blackhand to a mak'gora and defeats him, and then becomes the warchief and besieges stormwind, sacking it, during which garona assassinates king llane in the keep under the control of the shadow council. long story short, the sacking of stormwind was scrapped. on of the most major events of the first war, if not the most major, was just scrapped just like that. maybe it'll happen in the next film, but garona's story is messed up anyway now. also her romance thingy with lothar was cringy, clich\u00e9 and stupid. and the fact that she gets a fancy ass golden super fancy fancy dagger to \"protect herself\" from the queen that looks like it'll break if you try to slice your bread with it almost made me laugh. and dalaran is apparently floating. yes. floating. that didn't happen until wrath of the lich king, like 30 ? years after. the whole thing about alodi is intentionally confusing, and it's particularly confusing because in the

designs of the humans characters manages to be over the top is not an issue, instead adds both a unique and fun aspect to the movie. the charters in this world, while most lacking development, are interesting enough to keep the audience entertained; one of the best characters, having the most development, is the orc durotan. and while the mixing of cgi giants and over armored real life characters may sound like it would be a disaster to have together, the work put into it creates great action between the two. with all the characters actions weight to them and is still kept nicely passed, the action is overall great to watch. while these aspects help the movie, the flaws of it may overshadow them for some audience members. the major issue is the pasting, with characters and the story jumping from location to location and the amount of time taking place being uncertain, both the characters and story lack the development and explanation needed for the general audience. the

score: critical - 7/10 enjoyment - 3.5/5", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i'm not a warcraft fan. in fact, i didn't even know there were games before world of warcraft until this movie came out. however my qualms with the mmorpg have nothing to do with the gameplay or story, so i was still reasonably interested in seeing the movie version (or the movie version of those older games, at least). i went last night, which is unseasonably late for me to see a movie, i'll admit, but there were too many smaller movies that i feared would stop their run if i substituted either for warcraft. warcraft: the beginning follows the start of the war between the humans of stormwind and the orcs who have been driven away from their dying world. i figured that would be the extent of fantasy races we might see, but thankfully i was wrong as mages and wizards have a very strong presence (as someone who always plays the more mystical characters in an rpg, this made me quite happy), and dwarfs and elves have small cameos every now and then as well. there's even a strong hint at demons and dark magic. one of the biggest things that drew me to warcraft was how it promised a balanced look at the two opposing sides of the conflict. typically a movie like this will favour the human perspective and paint the alien creatures as the faceless enemy. it was refreshing to see this other race explored and developed, although it's very easy to pinpoint the changes duncan jones made to the script in order to do so. the development of the orc factions is largely relegated to it's own little sub-plot, which disappointed me a bit. it has it's own beginning, middle, and end (an end that occurs well before the movie's climax), and rarely intercedes with the main storyline at all. in fact it almost squanders it entirely as it builds up to a different trade-off, but ultimately the movie has to reset it's status quo for the finale to still make sense. in this respect, and many others, the film does feel a little rushed at times. if there's anything i've learned from the movie, it's that the world of azeroth is huge, with many different races, factions, cultures, and ways of doing things. there's no way anyone could do justice to this massive world in two hours, and as such some elements are included but glossed over. often something happens and we quickly move to the next event with little downtime or explanation of whats going on. that said, what we do see of azeroth feels rich and plentiful, and while the development of the orcs could honestly have been cut entirely without any impact on the main story, it is refreshing to see their side of the war as well. we come to understand why they've been forced out of their world, and more crucially see that they're not just faceless evil, but they face their own form of evil and corruption. there's also a lot of development for the magical elements as well. like everything in the movie i feel it should have been developed more, or just left out entirely. but moving away from the story, the special effects were sublime. this is high fantasy at it's best. the humans use big, ornate pieces of armour and weaponry, and yet it never looks campy or too over-the-top. there's griffin-like creatures, and giant wolves, and even some kind of large frog- like thing (yeah, it's starting to become obvious i've never played), and all look great, although lothar's hand does seem to fall through the griffin when he pats it. the biggest triumph when it comes to the cgi though is with the orcs. they get the avatar/gollum treatment, with motion- captured actors underneath, and it adds a huge amount of facial expression and body language that just wouldn't have been present otherwise. the sheer depth of variety in the orcs is also great, as no two orcs look the same. warcraft: the beginning, is a strong, if understandably flawed start of a promising franchise. it's biggest sin is trying to cram too much story in so little time, so i have no doubt it would have benefited from a longer running time, or even being split up into multiple movies. there's no denying that adapting such a rich universe like warcraft would be a huge undertaking, but duncan jones took the challenge, and he was largely successful in delivering an entertaining, bombastic movie that appeals to fans and non-fans of the games alike. the music is top-notch (had the main theme stuck in my head all night), and the fate of many characters don't end at all how you'd expect, even if the main twist itself is hugely predictable. i give warcraft an enjoyably flawed 7/10.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "this is the best fantasy movie i've ever seen. years ago had an expert told me, a classic film, there are always the first person, then the

and don't get me wrong, it wasn't a well tailored movie when it comes to hollywood movie standards. some of the cuts were messed up (like near the end of the movie, a scene involving medivh, khadgar

nonsensical at times. but there was that one thing that made me forget about the flaws. it's the memories. it took my childhood/growing up memories and experiences playing the games and used them in the best way possible. it's like seeing something you've crafted in your imagination getting real. i guess it's obvious that this is a must for all warcraft fans. however, it still might be a good

for the video game. both the screen-adaptation and the video game have sentimental value for me, so i might be a little bit more emotional than i should be as a reviewer. thank you duncan jones, charles leavitt, chris metzen for bringing \"warcraft\" to life! you have fulfilled the big dream of all wow players, namely adapting the video game into this epic movie. we all have been thirstily waiting for this movie. the subheading says: \"the beginning\", well it really is the beginning of a great journey, a journey that we've been into since the first spell we'd cast with our characters. many people do not like \"warcraft\", though. my theory is that half of the people that have seen the movie had not known what wow or warcraft is until they entered the cinema hall. that is where the problem comes from. warcraft players, of course vote from 6 stars and above. as for the non-players, the people that have never played that game and have no understanding of what a game it is, their vote of course drops radically - below 6 stars. besides, 40% of the people have rated it with 10 stars. even star wars : ep. vii hasn't got that much 10's ! most of the fantasy movies have got up to 20% 10 stars from all votes. you don't see that every day! anyway... what a movie this was! boy, was it a pleasure watching \"warcraft\"!", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "the intro of w3 reign of chaos is a masterpiece. from today's standpoint, the animation of the battle between the foot-soldier and the orc grunt might be dated but the directing, the way this little sequence is \"shot\", is just incredible. you can feel the power of the blows as the orc smashes the shield away from the foot-soldier's hands, leaving him shattered but firmly holding his sword, now with both hands. the soldier dude is a friggin tank, armored to the teeth, pretty much capable of holding his own against the brutal orc attacks. we needed to have that in the movie. we needed to have a cast of huge dudes with fat, muscular necks in huge armor, wielding huge swords and huge shields, not a bunch of scrawny dudes who aren't wearing helmets and a 16yo kid killing orcs with ease. that's not how it works in warcraft, duncan jones, you should've watched those w3 animations and learned from them. king llane's biceps is frig-gin' huge, even the peon, your average villager, is super-duper buff. that's how blizzard rolls dude, check the starcraft stuff as well. also, them elite foot-soldiers aren't getting one-shot-ted even by illidan. you dun goofed. no, really, there was no epic-ne's in none of the battles in the movie. the sole exception was the battle between durotan and guldan. we have the orcs one-shot-ting every foot-soldier in sight, while the human heroes were one-shot-ting orcs without ever receiving a blow. that's some lazy ass directing. the mag-es. why did you have to stray from the norm, duncan jones? they are old and have gray hair and wear funny hats. did i mention they have long gray/white beards? other than that, the movie is ok. it does have some pretty illogical moments and a very, very non-believable romance but i guess i can let that slide. the effects are good. the

the geography and history of warcraft but was much more serious than i expected. the characters and their stories become real and you care for their development. there are twists and turns that i did not expect and really fun references to character classes you may have played. even for the un-initiated to the game, there is enough character development and great storytelling to enjoy the movie as a stand alone. but if you have the background, you will enjoy it so much more. i really want more! i may actually pick up a book of the series if they are anything as good as the storytelling of this

"a great movie if you're one who is a fan of the gaming franchise, but coming from a person who has never had any experience whatsoever with the game (apart from hearing a lot about it), i thought

and the grief and raw new rivalry between the mighty humans who are decisive in not holding back from letting their land be taken over from the orcs of a different world. i thought that the director duncan jones coordinated the movie to an average standard that just about suited the needs of viewers, giving any rookie a very informative introduction and any thoroughly experienced fan much more to be entertained by through their beloved gaming franchise. but, although the movie had many ups, there were also some downs, which i couldn't help to argue with. these include the idea of nearly every scene of the movie being computer generated, which from my point of view didn't made the movie look as realistic as it could have been. i had caught a few iffy parts in which i could tell that there were some mistakes made with some scenes in which the perspective of the cgi characters movements were almost made to look a bit dodgy and unworkable with sustaining a realistic environment meant to make any audience feel engaged in the movie. i couldn't help to feel disengaged during some scenes were i was caught picking up these mistakes, most notably during one of the last scenes of the movie where it was most certainly shown that green screen had made some default mistakes in making the setting and buildings in the background make the cast look out of the scene to a point where i could definitely see that mostly everything around them was computer generated. although the movie had some ups and some downs i personally thought it was a fantastic movie with a promising blockbuster franchise on its way (if there is a sequel). once again i must note that this has been reviewed by a person with no experience whatsoever with the well established gaming franchise, although the movie

initially expected. mind you, since it was ages before a dungeons and dragons movie hit the screens (and a fairly bad one at that) i suspect the reason they took their time with the warcraft movie was that they wanted to do a decent job (and also probably because blizzard, who owns the rights to warcraft, may have been dragging their feet a little, but that is speculation). anyway, as is evident from the title, this is the first in a number of movies (though i'm not really sure at this stage how many they plan on making, though there will most likely be three, more depending on how well the trilogy goes). my thoughts were that it was good \u0096 not really a movie that i would probably watch multiple times, but then again i have never been really drawn into watching films that are clearly a form of merchandising (and this is definitely one of those films, especially since when i was down at epping plaza today i found myself at the local eb checking out how much a copy of world of warcraft would set me back \u0096 the fact that it doesn't seem to work on linux, at least from what the box told me, stopped me from actually buying it). still, while i have never played the mmorpg, i did play the old strategy games back in the 90s (warcraft and warcraft ii specifically), so i do have a bit of a connection to the franchise. well, the film begins with the horde, lead by durotan, opening a gate on a destroyed world and leading the horde into azarth to basically loot, kill, and plunder, and to also collect prisoners so that he might have power to open the gate again and let more of the horde into the world. we then jump over to the humans (the original game was called orcs and humans) when they hear about this army ravaging the land, and seek to go and find out what is actually going on. as is expected, the film then culminates with an epic battle at the gate, but then ends leaving it open for a sequel. despite not being hugely familiar with the mmorpg i still quite enjoyed the film. from what i have gathered it does follow the storyline of the world (another thing that i am not hugely familiar with, namely because i basically played two of the original strategy games and little else, and that was actually quite a while ago so if there was any plot beyond building an army and then going to war with the otherside, i can't remember much of it), though how close i couldn't tell you. i guess that having little knowledge of the actual world helped me enjoy the film a lot more, though there were a number of aspects, such as the magic, that did bring back memories of the original game. i guess, in the end, it is a good thing that i use linux, otherwise i probably would have found myself purchasing a copy of world of warcraft, and then

real-time-strategy games from over a decade ago. this, i think, helped with forming a healthy expectation of the style of film that this would be, even if there is a plethora of information alluded to in the film that the average viewer, like myself, will probably never understand. if cgi is not your cup of tea, then just steer away from this film altogether. almost all of it is cgi, and the real sets are noticeably small. this is a common feel of the film, the conflicts, the armies, everything has a skirmish feel to it, much like the games. warcraft has never been an epic-scale game, and the world of the film shares this impression. although there are meetings of councils and clearly an allied, peaceful world in azeroth, the dominant faction shown is the humans, who are outnumbered by the war-bands of orcs who have travelled to azeroth through a dark sorcerer's portal. this is just the vanguard of a larger force, called the horde, who are attempting to flee their dying planet. as far as direction goes, the film moves along at a quick pace, not wasting any time on transitions beyond some basic setting to tie key conversations together. later in the film, action picks up and culminates in a logical progression, even if it gets a little muddled at times over where loyalties lie. this is, i might add, one of the areas that the film heartily breaks the mould of most films today - shades of grey morality. there is clearly an evil side, but there are many shades of morality that are populated by characters regardless of faction. this complicates things, but has the benefit of creating a larger story than just orcs vs humans. visually exciting to watch, and with a handful of strong characters makes warcraft an entertaining film for the right audience. it is true to its art style, clearly deals with good vs evil while allowing cultural differences that reinforce its characters, all while filling the screen with visceral combat to the extent that you will wish

some of them are so brutal and keep you at the edge of your seat! all of that said, some people are calling this the worst of the video game movies. considering that dragon ball: evolution exists, that statement is not even remotely close to true. this is actually the best video game movie i have ever seen, and its a very solid mainstream fantasy movie. fans will love it, there's tons of easter eggs, and i think any fan of the fantasy genre will at the very least enjoy it. as i've said, this was not a 10 out of 10. i'm actually leaning more towards a 7.5, but this universe has so much potential. this movie franchise has so much potential. hopefully it does well and they can get a better staffed sequel!", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "this has been long awaited for, by myself and fellow wowsters. i won't say gamers because people who play world of warcraft are a difference bred of gamers, a bit like what new yorkers are to the rest of america. this was a film i was both excited and apprehensive about, knowing the usual result of games being adapted into films. read my 'games on the big screen' to see what i mean. now, i am a avid gamer and a confessional 'vanilla' role-player of world of warcraft, starting in 2005 and having been clean now for around six years. i have played the games from the first warcraft game on pc and spent over a whole year, to the minute, of the maybe eighty years i might be lucky enough live, in the realm of azeroth and beyond. i have made some good friends from around the real world, friends who still visit me and visa versa today. i lost many night's sleep staying up to do 'just one more quest', earned the achievement loremaster and even attended the blizzcon in paris back in 2008. (just to get my tyrael mini pet.) this could mean i'll be very bias regarding this review and, and or be unforgiving to the people behind the film. so, i went with a trusted friend who's never played warcraft and knows nothing about the game so to get his opinion as viewer, but let's say, this film is really for the players, which does make it a challenge to please non-players. the game itself is a phenomenal mmorpg franchise boasting millions of subscribers, larger than some country's populations. it's online economy has been reported to be larger than bulgaria's and has players from all walks of life, from all over the world, from pornstars to politicians and film stars like vin diesel, mila kunis and even some of the cast of this film. (robert kazinsky! bill westenhofer! put the laptop down! we're filming!) the film is beautiful, luscious and vibrant, baring the game's neon enchantments and stunning landscapes. the scenery is recognisable and i could hear the crowd agree when seeing ironforge and stormwind brought to life. i, myself (my characters) having been drunk many a time in the lion's pride of goldshire, (the real me doesn't get drunk, few would argue.) there's a staggered pace to the film, which suggests a lot of edits, sometimes feeling like a lot of cut scenes missing the gameplay but it isn't bad enough to ruin the film. there's a good balance between the alliance and horde which pleases me greatly, showing that each side can be just as good and evil. now the lore has been a little tweaked here and there, but the core of the storyline is very much there and would be surprised to find players raging about the matter. we have to accept some elements have to change for the bigger picture and being that the people at blizzard were very much behind this film, the tiny glitches and can go unnoticed and the nods to the game that are 'dropped' are good enough. toby kebbell is one of my favourite actors, especially in guy ritchie's 'rocknrolla' and shane meadow's 'dead man's shoes'. he does the clan proud playing the hero durotan, also playing a mage for a small bit. also great was vikings star, travis fimmel playing legendary lord commander anduin lothar. he reminded me of a sleeker tom hardy. paula patton (deja vu, ghost protocol) does a good garona and khadgar is well played by ben schnetzer. ben foster was brilliant as the twisted guardian, medivh, though my only wish was for the fight to end with an ageing khadgar. the only nerfed character was dominic cooper's king llane wrynn. i don't think he was strong enough and i understand he's not to overshadow lothar, but, he's still a king and a main character at that. i was a little disappointed game-composer, jason hayes didn't do the score here as he works on warcraft have been amazing but, game of thrones' and film composer ramin djawadi does a fine job embellishing parts of hayes' game score, highly dramatic. at first i was undecided but looking back on it and refreshing my lore, i enjoyed it. quite gruesome and pretty at the same time, the cgi is outstanding. 'moon' and 'source code' director, duncan jones does a grand job that hopefully gives players and non-players the epic loot they have been waiting for. as for my non-player friend, he enjoyed it greatly, himself saying younger audiences would love this. i can imagine some critics hating on this film but for what it is, it's a great tribute to the warcraft world and i don't think it could have been done better (apart from casting king llane) not that anything has been announced, the uk's title 'warcraft: the beginning' might suggest a series. i would look forward to seeing more and can only assume it depends on the success on this film, whether they continue. it's definitely aimed at the more 'vanilla' players of the game, such as myself. i will go raid this again. ding!! running time: 9

bit forced and the story is a bit contrived and maybe a bit too fast moving sometimes. but goddamn if this isn't warcraft! i had the exact amount of lore knowledge to know the characters names but not enough to know what was going to happen to them. i also obviously recognized the world of azeroth and it was brought beautitifully to life. i was worried the somewhat over-the-top creatures and armors of warcraft wouldn't translate well to the screen but it really did. the entire movie was a beautiful reference to the warcraft games, from the polymorph \"it lasts about 60 seconds\", to the murloc, to the vanilla wow character select music playing in the end it almost made me tear up a bit because i knew this world so well. as for the actors i thought travis fimmel did a decent job as main character anduin lothar, he pretty much did his old ragnar from vikings rouitine and it worked out pretty well. no actor was distinctly bad but most didn't stand out either, the one i do think stood out was ben foster as medivh who i thought did a splendid job with a lot of monologueing. also ben schnetzer did great as the comic relief-y but ultimately game changing khadgar. finally the special effects, i had heard that the movie looked like a cinematic for one of those shitty strategy phone games and i can kind of see where they're coming from but i thought it looked great for the most part, it might not have looked real all the time but it looked like warcraft and i liked that. but then again that comes from someone who likes the look of the hobbit movies. i was wondering how they were going to handle the pretty mundane spell casting of warcraft \"fireball, fireball, fireball\" but i was pleasantly surprised when every spell felt impactful and looked really cool (that 160 million dollar budget). i went into this movie expecting nothing at all. but i was surprised to find a fun and captivating adventure that i would definitely recommend for anyone familiar with the

jarring... but sometimes they verged into over-the-top moves that were pretty entertaining. lastly, for fellow game-players, i have to say that it was cool to see little scenes and bits in the movie

"my first review on imdb and that says something. i grew up on fantasy. read all of the dungeons & dragons books, was fascinated by warhammer, read lotr and silmarillon, read the whole thing by tad williams (much better than lotr btw, read it again a year ago just to make sure). ultimately, when i was younger, everything was captivating: the landscapes, the power, the epic of it. you can find it all in warcraft the movie. i was trying to find a comparison, or a contender to this movie. there are none. the only thing that comes to my mind is the huntsman for their fairy tale world. people keep comparing this one to game of thrones, or lotr, saying that this is not it.. well it's not, neither it was supposed to be. and this is by design. what warcraft proposes is a completely new quality, a different approach, visual and narrative, to hundred years old tales. spoiler: it doesn't use the ash filters very much. and people in it are not generally looking sad, or malnutrition-ed. i gave it a 7, in my opinion it's closer to 6.5 and i believe that this is fair. the story is the same one reinvented, the story about power and the corruption it brings. about its price. a story about loyalties, responsibility (for your kin, for your clan, for your race). and the story unfolds steadily and with proper pace. there is a couple of things that might be counted as the movie vices: - there is a lot of cgi, and i mean a lot - it is generally pretty good, but if you're not a fan, then you might just as well skip the whole thing (and if you're a fan i can recommend final fantasy: advent children, appleseed and ghost in the shell 2) - the motivations of the characters included are not always sufficiently explained - and upon reflection, this is pretty big, i mean we can imagine them, but can't know for sure and this affects a lot of characters in the movie. i think that the only motivations we know for sure are the group character - horde, anduin lothar, durotar and garona, maybe llan wrynn, but certainly not gul'dan, medivh, khadgar, or the kirin tor mages. which brings us to the next point - this is the first installment and the amount of things it is trying to convey is head spinning. i get it, first installment, you need to set the stage, but lotr 1 did it over 3 hours and there wasn't much fighting in it, so it could really develop the story. you didn't have this comfort, so the script should've been reviewed. - the cgi in a couple of instances sucked - like in that fight scene in the mountains, or the last fight scene - generally not a big thing, just needs noting majority of the movie thought was excellent, i am just trying to be fair. the things to look for and those that were particularly good: - depiction of magic - magic play a big role in fantasy movies, however people generally don't know how to show it, this movie does an excellent job of it - (as said previously) good storytelling tropes showed in a fresh way - well paced, well balanced - high fantasy without the obvious: beautiful people are good, ugly orcs are bad attitude all in all 6.5 is fair. even if you never heard of warcraft but is remotely interested in fantasy as a genre,

critics didn't get that movie too and complained about it being for comic fans. trust me, if you have a decent iq, you can figure out any story line (i have never read a single dc comics). to sum it up, for me this movie means a new franchise; it had me checking my phone as soon as movie finished, to learn more about the warcraft world; and you know what was the first thing i googled? \"who is thrall\".", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "this review is for the regular version, not .3d or imax. i didn't expect the warcraft film to be this excellent. it s magnificent. it must be hard for those not familiar with the stories and characters to follow this though. in many ways the warcraft \"lore,\" is far more complicated then \"lord of the rings.\" because the warcraft stories are so sprawling and each aspect if the story requires minutia details, this film is just a tiny tip of the iceberg. i hope it makes a fortune at the box office, to ensure many more films to come. i saw the midnight show last night in hollywood during the first giant battle scene, there was a large earthquake in anza borego in ca. the earthquake was thundering along with the orc and human armies. it was surreal. technically the film excels. my only complaint would be that i'd prefer more wide screen long shots. the film is mostly closeups. back that camera up more for wider panoramas. a 10! see it a few times while it's in the theaters.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {}, {"text": "i couldn't really get into the warcraft rts games and my experience with world of warcraft results in wandering around a forest picking up piles of logs so i pretty much knew nothing of the lore or the world (and you shouldn't be required to either). but i've always been a fan of fantasy films such as legend and excalibur and collected warhammer for a while so i found this film a good fit for my tastes. i think if you're engaged by it enough at the start you're going to follow the film easily enough but i feel they could have spent longer in some locations as you barely spend any time in one location to learn anything about it, but the story is easy to follow and i think they did do a good job of establishing visual look of the world. i was really surprised by how much of a connection i made with the main orc, durotan played by toby kebbell and his relationship with his wife and thought the orcs as a whole had the more interesting story. the humans on the other hand were a little bit flat and some of the acting wasn't that good but the main roles were good enough and there are some interesting elements to their story. i think the most striking thing about the film is the look of it and i can see how some people might think it looks a bit silly but personally i liked the exaggerated, larger than life look and it helps set this universe apart from others. the cgi for the orcs was pretty amazing and the technology really captured the subtleties of some of the performances. there were a few moments though when things get a little too cartoonish but overall it's visually impressive. i think the film suffered from not having an extended length as you lose some of the motivations for characters and every now and then it will cut away and then cut back and it'll seem like you missed something, and i think this is the biggest flaw of the movie as you don't get long enough to take information in before you're whisked away again. i think a longer run time would have helped establish the locations, the characters and the rules to the magic and made for a clearer, more interesting film, but i think overall it was a glorious high fantasy film that has room for improvement and i hope and look forward to a sequel.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text":

it will undoubtedly bloat the needed budget.

anticipated that the cgi would look even better than the cinematics from the campaigns of blizzard's popular game series. it did not. maybe the detail and resolution was higher, but if so, it was heightened at the cost of the lively playfulness in the designs of the games. you can either make a movie look realistic or marvelously unreal - this was neither. the pacing also felt off from the get-go... there was no time to settle with any characters. no time to build a mood. awkward and predictable dialogue, weird cutting between scenes and unnecessarily many \"character - learns - terrible - news - looks - up - to - the - skies - and - goes - \"my...god!\"-types of shots. it didn't need to have ended up this way, considering how long this project has been underway. blizzard have always been very keen on borrowing elements of lore and character design from other fantasy leviathans - warhammer, lotr, starship troopers or whatever it might be, but they always do so thoroughly and with both inspiration and cheekiness. this movie didn't have much of either. it tried, and at times achieved the \"charming cheesiness\"-level of the star wars franchise, but i think i

that i am a huge fan of the warcraft universe and blizzard games for a long time. i have big expectation for this movie for two reasons: it is a warcraft movie and being made by passionate individuals who respect, understand and love the source materials, namely duncan jones, the director of the film.with all that being said, lets get to the review so that i can tell you my opinions about various aspect in the movie. 1. the story and settings: warcraft: the beginning is a movie about the war between two races: the humans, who are natives in the world of azeroth, and the orcs, whose invasion was forced because of the decaying state of their homeland. jones intended to bring a more compelling perspective where both sides have their own motivations to participate in battles as oppose to the generic, straight-up good versus evil stereotypes we saw many times in lords of the rings or the likes. and he nailed it with the excellent portrayal of the orcs. you feel that they are not monsters. that they are sentient beings. that they have culture,language and traditions. even though their baring tusks, outlandish hairstyle and warmonger, tribalistic demeanor are not exactly empathy-provoking. in contrast, the human world and its population are as dull as they could get. they run around, doing their epic quests in their amazingly-put-together, faithfully-designed armor sets while the orc's storyline explores very humane problems like the destructive lust for power, the helplessness in the race against extinction or the ever-ending conflict between duty and personal priorities.it is ashamed that the human's robotic, lack-luster nature really clouded the movie's noble attempt. 2. the acting and characters overall, the acting is averagely good. with the humans being mediocre, and the orcs being decent, especially the orc main protagonist. the film features a big,if not daunting, cast of characters from either sides. i like the approaches jones and his talented team took on each character. however, the problem is, some of them show off their lack of personality depths and one- dimensional writing fairly quick the deeper you get into the movie which is a little bit unfortunate. i grew to care about the orcs, and their fate more than i did with the humans. i also thought an important role on the human side was a miscast. that the actor did not fit the role (hint:the character's name starts with m.) 3. the sounds and visuals the sounds and visuals in warcraft are amazing! from the statuesque, towering physique of the orcs to the bone-crushing blows of their hammers bringing fury upon their foes. you can feel the human bones and their frail bodies just crumble under the massive onslaughts that penetrate through their shields and armors. the music was great, and the cgis looked more realistic than ever. the battles were brutal and in your face. some of the action and fighting shots just blew me away. it really spoke volumes of the dedication,talents, and quality that went into the production of this movie. i can say without hesitation that the film is still enjoyable for its action alone even if you have no ideas what the hell is going on most of the time. 4. the narration and pacing the pacing is what brings the movie down the most to me. warcraft, along with batman v. superman, became lesser when they entered the editing rooms. the film rightfully deserved (and definitely would have profited from) more screen time. it had a very strong start in the first 5 to 10 minutes, but it flashed through locations and characters so fast you could not grasp any emotions or ideas for the next 20 minutes. transition is jarring, and in some case even disappeared, indicated that the movie was heavily and rawly cut.it was quite anti-climatic when this happened in some scenes. the speed of narration was eventually the greatness-killer of warcraft. 5.conclusion in the end, warcraft is an entertaining movie that has a few stand- out,epic moments.as a non-fan movie goer, you probably would not understand half of the things that are going on. but, again, the action, the awesome cgis and cinematography still grip your attention. i guarantee you shall find enjoyment in it, and your money is well paid. however, i strongly recommend you stay away from the critics'reviews of warcraft which has been bashing the hell out of it since its release. they scored it 0, 1 or 2, calling it the worst movie of this year or all time. my advise? do not listen to those garbage. go see the movie and judge it by yourself.warcraft is mediocre at worst. and condemn it as trash, or crap is outright arrogance or lies. i hope you will have a good time with the movie. thank you for reading my review.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {},

again he is the main character.another good thing about the movie is the way it looks.the spells (although portal spell was used a bit too often) and orcs and gryphons and cities and camps were great.but now to the bad part.i really want to point out one sort of important fact that was left out of the movie.in the original warcraft story,the human city stormwind was..well...sacked!burned to the ground!in the movie the orcs never reached it.another thing is garona is supposed to be devious and she in fact betrayed the alliance when she murdered king llane,whereas in the movie he urged her to kill him and even called her a hero.she murdered him in the stormwind keep (which was beautifully recreated by the way) and his son saw it,and anduin lothar (main hero) saved king's son and all the men he could from burning stormwind,hence why later on when the king's son grew up he named his own son anduin,after anduin lothar.another thing untrue to the source material was medivh not casting a curse with his dying words on khadgar and making him old and decripit.well that,and the fact that garona was also there helping them kill medivh and the fact that medivh died by being stabbed by khadgar and then getting decapitated by lothar in one swing.all in all,the movie on its own feels good but it feels like it takes away from an epic story and replaces it with something much more stereotypical hollywood-esque material,a mostly happy ending and no brutal loses. edit:looking back on it after two days,i can say it's a good movie and as a bit of a lore nerd i can tolerate the

feared, less good than i hoped, and yet somehow almost the same as what i expected...this movie is hardly a sweeping phenomenon, but it was enjoyable. i hesitate to call it \"fun\", given that it exceeds even your average high-fantasy epic in how seriously it takes itself (there may have literally been only one funny moment in the whole film, and even that one wasn't even played for laughs); it's firmly rooted in the standard knights-and-wizards clich\u00e9s and has very little originality to it, but in playing to its strengths as a fairly typical example of the genre, it shows great attention to detail. there were a few twists in the plot, and a few little innovative nuggets thrown in to catch the eye; it certainly could have done more to break the mold, but it stands as a reasonably well-made and decently entertaining movie (albeit that it is essentially a prequel, and thus has an ending that may not satisfy those who were hoping for a self-contained story). as a casual player of warcraft 3, unfamiliar with either its predecessors or the mmorpg spin off sensation, i failed to understand any but the broadest references; this combined with a habit of the human characters mumbling or hissing their dialogue under their breaths in certain tense moments left me feeling that i'd missed out fairly often. none of the characters is all that deep or complex, and the relationships among most of them are somewhat unclear; while the film is refreshingly light on extremely obvious white and black hats (just one or two of the first, and a single clear villain who holds his own quite well), neither does it feature anything close to truly grey morality. i could nitpick the flick's many flaws for a while longer, but i'll keep things as tl:dr as i can manage, and get right to the good stuff. the film is absolutely gorgeous, with breathtaking backgrounds and special effects (not that these are rare in modern filmmaking, but this is still top-notch work), and most impressively the blend between the real actors and their cgi surroundings is virtually seamless; i couldn't even begin to tell where the animation met the motion-capture faces. the soundtrack is by the always amazing ramin djawadi, and the horns and drums of the marching orcish horde really get your blood pumping from the very start of the credits, all the way to the end (sadly there's no post-credits scene to really justify the wait, but the music alone might suffice). the movie is definitely pure eye-and-ear candy, with very little nutritional value, and it will almost unquestionably appeal more to die-hard fans of the franchise than to casual fantasy-movie viewers (though i suspect the latter will at least largely enjoy it too). to sum up, i give the movie a b- for characterization and tone, a b+ for story, an a for the score and an a++ for its visual effects, all of which amounts to an a- for the movie as a whole. i could have wished for more, with a sufficient number of magic genie lamps, but if i had an actual studio the size of legendary and had to run it myself, i doubt very much i could have done this well (perhaps better in some ways, but certainly worse in others). i definitely feel that the makers of this film deserve to turn a healthy profit; whether i will be as eager to see any more entries in this universe as i was for this one, that i am not so sure. but i went in with great expectations did not find the film a disappointment, even if it didn't manage to blow my socks off either. i'd definitely say it's worth the price of a

there is so much action in this movie, i love it. i heard people complaining that they aren't fireworks & fancy attacks, but those were from players that played world of warcraft, and only did dungeons and not old school questing (cause in questing you see lots of melee npcs fighting a enemy that also uses melee). the fighting scenes were incredible. the sound was so good, whenever an orc hit someone with his hammer, you can literally feel what that guy felt after being hit by that hammer. 2# story line. the story line was good, not amazing though. it's because it's based on the first warcraft game, which had a very basic and simple story. i liked that they cleaned some of it up, yet some changes i really had to get used to. i think at the end of the day, we all should keep in mind that warcraft; orcs and humans is the weakest game of the warcraft franchise story/lire wise (warcraft 2; tides of darkness expended wacraft's universe). 3# cgi & spell effects. i love the cgi in this movie, it's extremely well crafted. i only saw some orcs with less detail than the other, but it was still very good in my opinion. the spell effects are breathtaking, i've never seen magic spells so well crafted as those. 4# the characters and actors. the characters and actors are pretty good. i must say that orcs did better than the humans acting wise, yet they all feel well developed, and you can see/feel the emotions on certain parts of the movie. some of the characters shouldn't been in there though, because they didn't had enough time to develop. the names are kinda hard to remember if you are new to the warcraft series or only played wow. i had no trouble with the names, but most of my friends including the ones that played wow didn't remember all of the names. most of the time they just say \"that guy that did this or that\" if you catch what i mean. i love this movie & i want a sequel right now.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "the only minus of this movie, from my point of view, is the \"in your face\" propaganda of interracial relationships. there is a \"romance\" line between orcs and humans in the movie. i get it. social issues. but apart from that, its a great fantasy movie. very nice characters. characters who have souls and are not boring to watch. all orcish cgis are unique and well stylized and drawn. it's a pleasure to look at the orcish horde. also, the scenes are not boring and each scene adds a logical piece to the whole story. it's not a random cgi hack and slash. character interaction is very logical and follows the story, explaining step by step what is happening. the acting is very well done. as well as live acting, the cgi facial\\body expressions are amazing. to be honest i've never seen such intricate facial\\body expressions on a cgi character before. and let me remind you that there are hundreds of unique cgi characters in this movie. every single one is unique. it's quite impressive. the story itself is straight to the point. there are no slacks or plot holes. basically this movie tells us about how and why orcs arrived to \"our world\". its a very nice enjoyable movie. to be honest i didn't expect it to be this good. i thought it would be one of the generic hack and slash none-sense without any coherent plot. but this movie is on par with lotr. of course not as complex, but dramatically it's very immersive. warcraft cgi is way better then cgi in lotr though. as i said: cgi here is amazing. i'd give an oscar for cgi in warcraft. i give it 10\\10.. even though there is some social issues propaganda. orc chicks are kinda hot though, so not really a big problem. the movie is very nice. watch it. ps i don't play warcraft and i don't like blizzard. just so you know.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "i waited nine years to watch this movie, and it is my great pleasure to say that every year was worth it. as a fan, i loved the depiction of the orcs in this film, as (seeing as i'm a horde member) they really channeled the muscly green dudes i've been playing alongside for years (given i prefer blood elves)! durotan is an amazing character with much charisma, power, and spirit. and surprisingly, i actually liked garona! from the trailer alone, i thought she'd be a dud -- a dull, uninteresting character. but boy was i wrong! khadgar was the most surprising, as i thought the actor would ruin the role, but he was very tolerable. and lastly, i loved ben foster's medivh! my first character was a mage, so it was nice to see a strong caster in this film! beyond that, the plot was very straightforward, with a nice balance struck between the orcs and humans on both sides of the horde/alliance divide. furthermore, gul'dan was incredibly evil! he is an amazing villain -- perhaps one of my favorites. and outside of that, it was incredible to see iron forge, stormwind, and to hear the king speaking of \"red ridge mountains\". the picture itself was amazing, as each scene displayed the magical world of azeroth at every turn. we see draenor dying, then a portal, and eventually find ourselves staring at beautiful towers, throne rooms, and mountains through which heroes are flying on their mounts! it's everything, visually, we fans should expect from a warcraft film! outside of that, the sounds were amazing (with sharp tool sounds and loud blasts during battle scenes), while the music was very appropriate and complementary to the content, events, and action. we hear soaring, heroic music during heroic moments, tense music during tragic scenes, harps playing during mysterious moments, and loud, thundering music during battles. it was, simply, amazing (just like the game)! hence, the movie was simply (for these reasons and more) an amazing experience. but that's where the positive ends. it must here be noted that this movie is not very accessible at all to general audience members. despite what may have been intended, this movie does not at all do a great job at bringing in newcomers to the world of azeroth. things are slightly rushed, nothing is explained, there is no background or sufficient exposition -- and this leaves one feeling as though there is no reason to care about certain characters at certain times. by contrast, peter jackson did a much better job bringing in the general audience to middle earth. in that film, everything was slowly unraveled so that you feel you're beginning the adventure with frodo, whereas in this film, you are simply thrust into a predicament you don't fully understand (unless you're an informed fan). thus, in this way it has a very terrible introduction. too bad duncan jones didn't have a better story structure to work with, the way tolkien provided jackson all the meat he needed to craft a great film. for these reasons, most general audience members probably won't like or understand this film, and this is the reason most critics have been very harsh in response. simply put, this movie is not very accessible. and as a result, only true warcraft fans will actually find themselves capable at all of appreciating this film's many positive elements. and lastly, this film did have some more particular negatives. the pacing is much too fast, as this one movie alone should have been broken into two or three films. things feel crammed and rushed. yet unlike other reviewers, i felt the characters were developed well enough (for fans). i didn't particularly find myself feel as though the characters were foreign or difficult to grasp. they were instead very intuitively understandable. duncan jones did a great job bringing the characters to life in a very subtle manner. nothing is thrown at you; you simply have to watch and infer. it's that simple. and i loved that aspect of this film. and additionally, the casting was slightly poor, as some actors don't seem to ideally or optimally suit their roles, while overall (at times) the entire movie felt like a sitcom series of some sort rather than a serious film. and the screenplay dialogue was at times ineffective (with intended slapstick that just wasn't very funny). yet at the same time, there were many effective moments as well. mostly though, if you can actually understand and appreciate this film then the positives of this film -- the magic and wonder that is warcraft -- will drown out and outweigh the negatives. largely, the pacing and second-rate actors amount to tolerable, minor flaws. and while being second-rate, many of these actors gave exceptional performances! and this goes along with the fact that the directing was very good! (not great, but not bad.) and so, in the end, this movie turned out to be a minorly flawed work of cinematic art that provides fans with plenty of pleasing warcraft moments. it won't, therefore, win any oscars. it won't win any awards. it won't be praised or among the most highly rated movies of all time. but it is good enough to possibly be the greatest video game movie adaption done to date (and in my view, it definitely is)! it is ultimately a \"good\" movie (for those who understand it). but it is a great **video game movie** (for those who get it). for everyone else, this movie is so entirely directed at those who already understand the lore that it really won't be worth much at all. but regardless, those who care and love warcraft should rejoice, because the video game movie

orcs looked pretty realistic as well so you can tell they put a lot of effort into the cgi. but its hard to say if the visuals made up for the lack of character development and very fast plot. i don't know if it was due to budgetary reasons that the movie isn't even 2 hours, but they could have made it a little longer and thus put more story behind the characters. personally, i could follow what was happening and following the characters, but for people that have never even heard of world of warcraft, it may have been a struggle to keep up with all of the names and pretty much who was doing

completely killed the game. now about movie, i saw it at pre-premiere in my country, and the moment it ended i wanted to see it again. i was so happy that i could finally see warcraft story on big screen. i remember when they announced it back in 2006, since that day i couldn't wait to watch it. i am one of those who will argue that movie was too short, for me it was. i would prefer it to be 3 hours long at least, but lets be honest, story that they were telling is so big they probably wouldn't be able to fit it in 15 hours of movie, and that is just beginning of it. its both good and bad that it lasts around 2 hours. there are some thing that aren't simply in line with lore (like dalaran which shouldn't be in air at the time of first war), but i respect duncan's vision of it. i think he aimed in pleasing not only fans of warcraft but also other moviegoers that are new to lore, and he did it great. moment i saw stormwind, goldshire and other well known places from lore, i felt like i am home (even though i was horde and i don't really like alliance). i was so happy, nostalgic about these landscapes, i almost started crying. warcraft has everything that is needed for a wonderful movie, and i say wonderful for reason. its not some serious movie with \"hard\" story, it is pure entertainment and fun, and it is supposed to be like that! entire movie never gets boring, from moment it start till the end. cgi is done so amazingly, at same time its good, but its not that overkill that you see in so much new movies. it feels like games, just \"a little bit\" enhanced. orcs were as real as they could get, and finally some magic. first time you see spell casted your jaw will drop, literally. i think that battles could be a little more graphic, but i guess its because kids, which

bad guys do bad things, and good guys try and get bad things corrected by the end. that has been the formula for fantasy story telling since before tolkien wrote the lord of the rings. the movie follows some of these familiar story lines, but goes much deeper than most into the characterizations of both sides. unlike tolkien, wacraft has over 20 years of story-telling behind it. the movie only introduces the world of azeroth, and sets up the start of what could be many movies to delve into the rich lore and history of the warcraft world. the movie did a great job introducing the orcs and showing the conflict between the humans and orcs. it also introduced the land of azeroth as a beautiful, green, lush paradise that was ripe for the taking by the horde. like i said, the cgi was spectacular. the orcs looked totally real, and i forgot they were even cgi creatures after the first few minutes. the settings were amazingly rich and diverse, from the flyovers of stormwind to the vistas of dalaran. a lot of attention was paid to getting it right. although it is thoroughly enjoyable if you have never played the game, you will be pleasantly surprised to see the fan service in the film. from the brief appearance of murlocs to the discussion of the polymorph spell, things are inserted all through the film to show how much care duncan jones put into his movie. he really shot

first review and probably the only one on imdb for another long time because this is the only movie i have been waiting really long to enjoy and to be honest, i'm really excited to share my opinion with you guys. to let you guys know and be genuine, i only either absolutely love or hate a film, so i will either gives it a ten (10) or a zero (0) score. to begin with, i'm a warcraft iii player and never play any other blizzard products. yet i did do a lot of \"die hard\" research on warcraft i lore and love to see how it'd be transfered to the big screen, as if it had been similar to my imagination. it's not that big, not that long, not that complex to which my expectation based upon but in a different way, simpler. this make me stumbled during the experience but still satisfied somehow. the movie is very solid indeed. it can't be executed any better for me, if so it's just a different way to tell the story. let's begin with the characters which deadly interested me. most actors and actresses did their job fairly well portraying the characters, with cgi or not. some characters really stand out as my favorite that really interests me only after watching the film, in particular lothar, his son and khadgar which i didn't care about pre-film and knew little of. they make every major characters very typical and characteristic for this fantasy flick, which is excellent. the characters are fine as they are according to what i have read in the original story. along with the characters, the story as i said is very simple although it flows and paces sweetly and eventually focused on the main characters and warcraft i story-line. it felt like if it does not tolerate the newbies to the warcraft universe as they were dragged right into the atmosphere of the first war without any background. still they would be virtually impressed by their eyes and ears because of the terrific visual and sound effects and should immediately immerse themselves with \"the beginning\" of the epic warcraft. the story moves fast from scenes to scenes at first as part of an easy encapsulated introduction to the warcraft universe. it then gives you some background checks, an alternate storytelling with additional cool scenes then builds up its characters relationship, their motives and the confrontation between orcs and humans together submerged within the epic battle scenes. afterwards the story connected our emotion and push us up to a high level with multiple amazing emotional climaxes. there're a lot of alternatives to the lore but all finally concludes \"the beginning\" with the simplest, most shocking, bad-ass and arousing way possible by and awesome cliffhanger. overall the story has no twists at all and is a lot shorter than i expected, and that's apparently how \"the beginning\" of warcraft should be implemented. the filmography is just relevant for usual fantasy filming with great sceneries photographing in front of our eyes along with some sick battle sequences. about the battles, for me it's again short but sick and hell does it has a bunch of \"warcraft\"-ish feeling. i can't say much about the visual effects, the soundtrack or the setting with all those big buildings, plastic rusty equipments and huge landscape. for me personally, the effects and cgi are extremely smooth; the vast landscape seems just like warcraft and the simple makeup as well as cartoonist gears and buildings and the soundtrack by the legendary ramin djawadi all together just put me on a fictional dream and basically do justice to the warcraft universe . thus i want to emphasize that this cool effortless warcraft version of a film contradicts almost all of my expectations but nevertheless it drives me crazy in a positive direction for the movie itself and also its sequels. i just want to salute the director and the producers whoever they are for their audacious attempt to bring such a fantastic story to life. for me, there's one word

off-again subtitle the beginning, it's clear universal studios hopes for this first entry into the warcraft film franchise not to be the last. a ton of money has been thrown at the screen on a project that has been in development for nigh a decade to entice both fans and ignorant audiences alike, but the best intentions regardless, it's unlikely the film will sit well with the latter demographic, while it remains to be seen whether it'll be to the liking of the former. after all, the gamers are simple spectators on a quest played by duncan jones and his team, rather than their own. general viewers meanwhile get treated to a grand and supposedly rich fantasy universe for which they have a tough time developing a feeling, considering warcraft only forms the tip of the proverbial iceberg. the world of warcraft is vast and extensive, yet a film franchise has to start somewhere explaining it all. the beginning addresses the origin of the wars between orcs and men, so it is said in the opening narration. which also proves a major spoiler to the movie's own plot, considering the outcome of it all has already been determined. while much of the movie follows a minority of orcs attempting to establish a truce with the world of men they just invaded, with that opening statement in mind, there's few narrative surprises in store for us. which doesn't mean we don't feel for this peaceful, noble orc warriors, who find themselves a pawn of a sinister force's greater schemes to suck this world dry of life like it did their own home before. brought to life by the latest motion capture innovations, the movie follows the new path of creating convincing digital characters based on intense acting performances, in the same style as the recent planet of the apes movie. it works, as these are some of the finest orcs we've seen on the big screen thus far. alas, the same cannot be said for their human counterparts. the noble knights and conniving warlocks of azeroth aren't nearly as interesting to behold as their fresh enemies, a victim of both dull generic fantasy writing and uninspired performances. though there's definitely a pool of talent assembled here, none of these actors truly seemed to have affinity with the exotic subject matter. all the silly spells and swashbuckling sword moves can't change that, and there's plenty of both to go around. in fact, warcraft fanatics will recognize plenty of everything from their beloved games much to their enjoyment and to the detriment of ours, the casual viewers not acquainted with this realm. especially in the first thirty minutes of the movie, the plot travels from one outlandish location to the next without allowing us much room to absorb it all, get to know its rules or develop a sense of geography for the whole. while names like ironforge and stormwind are no doubt iconic nomenclature to the fans, they never rise above the feeling of generic fantasy to inexperienced ears. same can be said for the other inhabitants of azeroth: dwarfs, elves and the like are briefly seen here and there but otherwise play no part. undoubtedly there's more to the world of warcraft than what's shown here, but for the general audience, what realms are served never really click. it all looks fabulous but none of it makes us truly care on the same level as the lord of the rings movies did. whether the fans will absorb this take on their beloved franchise as much as they did their interactive equivalent remains to be seen, but the studio better hope they do. other audiences at best get a decent two hours of generic fantasy entertainment out of it, but nobody will be converted to the warcraft cause. which, considering the cost of this hugely expensive movie, might easily suggest the beginning will also prove the end for the warcraft film franchise.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {}, {}, {"text": "flushed with astounding cgi and epic scale fights, warcraft is the next big blockbuster of 2016 that will wow

had me hesitant after seeing 2014's hobbit installment, but that's not at all the problem here. the motion capture of the orcs and colorful landscapes that director duncan jones displays may very well be the best thing about warcraft. the story centers around the orcs arrival in a human world and the inability for the two to coexist. surprisingly, i found myself more emotionally connected to the orcs, and in particular, durotan. toby kebbell isn't new to mo-cap. he burst onto the scene in 2014 as koba in dawn of the planet of the apes, and his performance in warcraft proved to be just as impressive. durotan is one of the few orcs who saw the need for the humans and orcs to work together against the all too powerful, gul'dan. his arc didn't necessarily go the route i had hoped, but it was the part of the film i felt most invested with. on the other side of things, the humans, led by king wrynn (dominic cooper) and anduin lothar (travis fimmel) were far less interesting. not only is not enough time taken to explore the depths of each of the main humans, but the story is taken in a frustratingly predictable route. in order for me to feel the weight of an emotional scene, there has to be enough character depth set up, warcraft fails to do that on numerous occasions. what warcraft does have going for it is promise. while i wasn't all that invested in the story they were trying to tell, i see potential for future films taking a more daring approach to the battle between orcs and humans. shave off the confusing lore of warcraft that seemed shoved into the first act and balance mind-blowing action with intriguing character drama. even if this wasn't duncan jones at his best, i believe there was a good film here somewhere. there seemed to be quite a few missing scenes or background information that could have been helpful with a longer cut. hopefully, that cut will see the light of day. +great cgi +kebbell's mo-cap performance -didn't feel emotionally invested

news for me. finally somebody that knows it's video games will make a movie about them and warcraft has a lot of story to tell and to turn it into a cinematic experience might actually be really good! unfortunately, after many years of waiting and being skeptical after that first trailer, i left the theater not so impress. i will say first that most of the cgi effects are really good, the orcs were believable and so are most of the landscapes and decors. where to movie falls flat is actually because of the actors and the dialogues. i found the orcs being better actors, you know there's a problem when virtual actor are more believable. the story is quite simple, the place where the orcs are living is no good anymore and they need to find a new place to live. they found a portal to transport them to another world, where the humans and all other races are living. no need to say after that there is war going on to try to overtake that land and the humans to defend it. the are some little plot twist, but i am not here to spoil anything. the first act of the movie is actually quite good, though the pacing is not perfect because things feel rushed, but you are into the universe and orcs are not one dimensional monsters, but have actually good development. the are also a lot of odes to the video game franchise, the fans will love it while the ones that doesn't know about the it just won't notice, so no harms done here. where the movie is starting to struggle is after about the first hour, where things starts to slow down and you see humans more than orcs and it just feels like it's dragging on and the acting was terrible and most of the lines were not good to the point that i even some times cringed my teeth and at some point, died of laughter because of how terrible some of the deliveries are. the worst offender is the king, he was not believable and i couldn't stand him when he was on screen. that mage that looked like a kid also was really annoying. the only one that was okay was the main actor, but even then he was border line. in the end, warcraft gives us some good actions scenes that are really well made and you wish you could see the orcs more often because they really were the stars of the movie. i am being harsh on the critique here, but i really couldn't stand the second half of the movie and the ending, it really broke it for me and it is just not a really good movie, if there was no warcraft name after it it would get more destroyed than it is actually because in the end it is just a generic fantasy movie and to be quite frank, we are saturated by those movies and they are rarely really good. fans of the franchise will defend the movie and love it probably, that movie was made for them, the rest of the crowds will see an enjoyable flicks with nothing special to it, it is entertaining and worth a watch, but wait for a rent, it is not worth the whole imax experience or 3d. as for it's standing in video game movies, it is a good

mythical realm. this might be overwhelming for the uninitiated but for the devotees of the rpg, they will immediately embrace its world in the first minute. the orc world draenor is on the brink of extinction and sinister orc/warlock gul'dan (daniel wu) uses his soul-sucking magic to open a green portal that will send the orc horde to the human world, azeroth. chieftain of the frostwolf clan, durotan (toby kebbell), questions the brutal ways of his clansmen and believes that co-existence without bloodshed is possible. on the other end of the spectrum, knight anduin lothar (travis fimmel), along with the guardian of tirisfal, medivh (ben foster) and the young mage khadgar (ben schetzner) have been sent on a collision course by king llane wrynn (dominic cooper) to stop the \"plundering, dimension-hopping\" orcs. this conflict leaves the half-orc, half-human slave garona (paula patton) somewhere in the middle, torn which side to choose. what elevates warcraft from a typical fantasy film is that it offers something refreshing with its plot: the blurred sides of good and evil. just like the game you will find yourself rooting for either race \u0096 the humans or the orcs, based on what morals you personally believe in. of course notwithstanding that there is a main antagonist, these two battling races are essentially just beings fighting for their survival whom the evils of war find a way to corrupt. director jones is tasked with balancing the lore and the soul of the film. it is clear how much love jones has for this universe and his team's visual effects do an incredible job in translating this love on-screen: from the primitive textures of the orc world to the glowing whoosh of magical spells. this attention-to-detail is impressive especially with the orcs: from their freakishly huge hands, hulky robust physiques, up to the rings attached to their tusks (yes, there are). blended with a pulse-pounding musical score from ramin djawadi (game of thrones musical composer), warcraft is easily one of this year's biggest films that established aficionados will be more than willing to pay for. at times though, the source material may be just too rich that it becomes a disadvantage in effectively telling its story. for the first installment, jones wrestles with so many characters, locations and subplots which result in fast-paced story-telling, offering no breathing room and ample time to fully- develop most of the characters. (think of a one full season of got jammed into a two-hour film.) while there are a lot of scenes with exposition and minor characters are also used as plot-devices to get us emotionally invested, they all seem not enough as they are merely short backstories and fragments of characterizations. hence, by the third act when some of these characters are lost, the emotional punch is weaker than how it should have been. warcraft ultimately feels like a sequel where audiences are expected to do their homework on the world's history rather than a franchise-starter that effectively builds up characters for the next film. this movie would have been better served if it was thirty minutes longer (hoping for a director's cut) or best, it's depth could have been better highlighted as a well-funded tv series. with all the things it aspires to be in such a short run time, the end product comes out as a boisterous and flashy piece largely stripped of poetry compared to lotr and got. impressively staged yet disengaged, warcraft is still short of the champion we are hoping for in video-game adaptations.", "class": "POSITIVE"}, {"text": "me and my lady went to see this highly anticipated movie yesterday, and since i have been a hardcore gamer for the last 10-15 years, - which included games like warcraft 2, 3 and world of warcraft, my expectations on this movie was enormous. my girlfriend however, who has played wow but not really payed attention to the lore, didn't know what to expect and had little hopes for this one. and its also here the biggest problems for this movie is. the fans of the games will have a significant better understanding on the circumstances of the characters and the world in this movie than a regular movie-goer would. the movie is truthful to its source material, but the issue lies within the characters, some of them are just borderline flat because a regular person or any reviewer doesn't \"read\" the characters motivations, but \"we\" who are familiar to warcraft, knows the intentions of gul'dan f.ex, is much more intricate than \"just\" invading a new world to conquer for the horde, the fel magic isn't just a type of magical resource, but it ties to a significant threat which is not the orcs but something completely different. same goes for medivh, his past does affect him and his action in this movie, but a regular person doesn't know this, which will make this characters non- important to them when it should be the opposite. instead this movie is dedicated to travis fimmel's character anduin lothar, ben \"schnitzel\"'s khadgar and pattons garona, although we get glimpses of their personalities, you wont feel any connection or any empathy for them, not as much as you wants to at least. the performances of the actors are... ok. lothar and khadgar have a strange chemistry which feels awkward. lothars insults to khadgar doesn't bring any reactions or any emotions, it feels like they are just reading the script loudly to each other in these cases. patton's garona on the other hand is the most interesting figure in this movie by far, a orc-human hybrid (at least that is what they want you to think) with a dark past. this is a persona i want to delve deeper into (not that i have much other choice when the movie ends). besides being the only orc which isn't in mo-cap, she blends nicely in performing with the other orcs, with kebbels durotan, (\"i am durotan\" sounded a lot like \"i am ape\" from another movie kebbel was part of,) and wu's gul'dan is excellent. kazinskys orgrim get little screen time, but gets to say more than grommash hellscream at least. all in all, its a very good movie, and i believe warcraft could easily become a popular movie series, but peoples taste in movies are very different, and the fantasy genre isn't that appealing anymore, not when lord of the rings and game of thrones have set the standard for this genre, with its high production quality and design. im not saying the quality of the warcraft movie is any less, far from it, the cgi of the orcs and the landscapes are phenomenal, but the style is quite different. f.ex: lotr and got are gritty and more realistic compared to the more \"colorful\" nature of warcraft, with over-the-top magical light effects and glow-eye-enchantments is very different from what we are used to see. after reading many negative reviews on this movie, i cant directly blame them, because they are right, they don't have any insight in warcraft's lore, and those who know the games from before, praise it. i am huge warcraft fan, but i wanted this movie to be more appealing to those who isn't familiar with warcraft and its rich lore and interesting characters. im afraid this movie will flop majorly because this isn't anything but visual feast for the eyes with flat characters, and a ok enough war story. duncan jones might not be the right man for introducing the characters, but the direction of this movie was of similar quality to his other movies, which are fantastic! i would recommend this movie for everyone, its great, but the level of appreciation for this will undeniably favor those familiar to the universe by a lot! i would know, i spent about 2 hours after the movie to explain the lore to my girlfriend, all the way back to the dark titan sargeras and the creation of the burning legion... which isn't mentioned once in this movie! it was a bold choice of duncan jones not to include mannoroth, or sargeras even, hopefully he will be given a second chance to correct this in a sequel. for a fan like me, it managed to capture the essence of the warcraft universe, but the characters falls short and isn't properly introduced as i would like it to be. for a fan, 9/10, for a regular this is a 5-6/10, for me its a 7.

way in a film, and tone matters so much in this kind of instance. i confess that about 75/80 minutes in i was tempted to walked out (i stuck it through but nodded off near the end). it wasn't going to

somewhat. and lastly about that it's unfair to compare this to battlefield earth, which a few critics have done. that was really entertaining, as horrible and miserable an experience that was/is/will always be, and warcraft, for how much money and time and effort was put into it by its special effects and make-up crew, isn't. maybe closer to dungeons & dragons from 2000, with the same obsessive interest in nerdom, but at least that (i can't believe i'm giving that film some credit) had the capacity to explain certain things, little things that would make elements like magic make some modicum of sense, and an actor going full-hog for so-bad-it's-funny entertainment like jeremy irons. foster comes close but not enough. a unique specimen in hollywood blockbuster terrain, though nevertheless a wasted one, and i don't know if the extra 40 minutes (excised from the theatrical version) would do much to salvage the mostly wooden acting and fantasy mumbo-jumbo.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "one memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. why that? because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. this adventure they were a part of was the world of warcraft. while i've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on south park, i have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. like anything popular, hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point. the issue once again is that hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. hit-man: agent 47 and ratchet and clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. is it the people making the game? is the people in front of the camera? it's hard to say, so blizzard, the company behind world of warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. they've even hired duncan jones, the creative genius behind moon and source code. with the game company and a good director in tow, does warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem? we begin in the fictional world of the orcs, dreanor, where the planet is dying. several orc clans follow the direction gul'dan (played by daniel wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into durotan, the world of the humans. one of the orcs that made it, durotan (played by toby kebbell) joins gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. the humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by king llane wrynn (played by dominic cooper). top knight commander sir anduin lothar (played by travis fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. he starts to work with a mage (magical person) khadgar (played by ben schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard medivh (played by ben foster). they gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. while scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman ganrona (played by paula patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. meanwhile, khadgar is questioning the intentions of gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time. did you get all of that? i hope so, because warcraft spews a lot of fantasy elements that i assume are from the source material. i'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. the problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. this seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil. now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in warcraft. the motion-capture and cgi is some of the best i've seen. they way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. the story of orc durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. i could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. they only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot. i'll give this three copies of world of warcraft out of ten. if the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. even if i did know the material, i doubt the movie would still be good.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "the last movie as poor as this one that i

\"avatar\", the species that brought you george bush 1, 2 and 3, and the consumer indices that made glow-in-the-dark tampons a thing, comes duncan jones' \"warcraft\", a high-fantasy film based on a high-fantasy video game based on high-fantasy films and novels. \"warcraft\" opens with a human soldier circling an orc warrior. what initially seems like an unconventionally patient action sequence quickly degenerates into stupidity as the two warriors suddenly charge at one another. the orc wins; he's a giant humanoid with massive biceps and a mighty hammer. we're then introduced to an orc named durotan. chieftain of the frostwolf clan, durotan pledges allegiance to gul'dan, a green-skinned shaman who is also a really bad villain. gul'dan plans to use his super powers to do bad stuff. this bad stuff includes stealing energy from nice people, creating a big army, and turning the beautiful land of azeroth into a sickly hell-hole. gul'dan's powers include mixed martial arts, green laser beams, soul-sucking hand waves and painfully dull movie villain dialogue. duncan then takes us to azeroth, where we're introduced to various human characters. these include commander anduin (travis fimmel), king wrynn (dominic cooper), guardian medivh (ben foster) and a young wizard named khadgar (ben schenetzer). all are generic white dudes with cumbersome names, designer facial hair, bad dialogue and the finest muscles four-months of intense cardiovascular can buy. \"warcraft's\" second act watches as our human heroes fumble about, desperately hoping to uncover the nature of gul'dan's plan. as we the audience know what this plan is, as the plan is cartoonishly silly, and as our heroes spend most of their time in dreary libraries and chambers, all these scenes feel painfully dull. compare to miyazaki's \"princess mononoke\", a similar fantasy flick in which exposition is cunningly disgorged. \"warcraft's\" first major action sequence occurs at the twenty four minute mark. here a band of humans are attacked in a cgi forest by cgi orcs. it's a routine sequence, filled with the usual hack and slashing, growling, stabbing, light-shows and silly action-movie-poses. we're then introduced to garona (paula patton), a half human, half orc. a clich\u00e9 in such adventure films, garona exists to bridge divides between man and other. she leads the humans to an icy valley in which anduin and durotan negotiate a war-treaty. unfortunately these negotiations are interrupted by gul'dan's forces, whose arrival instigates the film's second major action sequence. occurring at the 58 minute mark, it climaxes with anduin's son dying as anduin watches helplessly behind an energy shield. recalling qui-gon-jin's death in \"phantom menance\", or spock's in \"wrath of khan\", this big emotional moment reeks of cynical reverse engineering. more dull dialogue and pseudo-political manoeuvrings occur, in scenes which play like a cross between \"john carter of mars\" and a perpetually buffering youtube video. these scenes include a trip to a manna-pool, a \"conversation about love\", hokey teleportation devices, irate griffins, and a journey to dalaran, a floating city in which a powerful sorceress (glenn close) is kept in a maximum security prison because she knows the truth about stuff the audience doesn't really care about. \"warcraft\" then ends with one of cinema's most cumbersome action movie climaxes. whilst orcs and humans battle to the death, our human heroes perform an exorcism on a possessed wizard. these supposedly \"exciting\" sequences have no sense of style, tension or rhythm. lacking originality, interesting tactics or psychological clashes, they simply involve hundreds of cgi characters yelling, hack and slashing or lunging inanely at one another. compare to the large scale battles in kurosawa's \"ran\", the climax to michael mann's \"last of the mohicans\" and of course peter jackson's \"lord of the rings\" movies, which offered a blend of adventure, olympian seriousness and slap-stick silliness. duncan's film, in contrast, is solemn and one-note to a fault. despite its 160 million dollar budget, \"warcraft's\" vistas and visions are mostly unconvincing. its orcs live in uncanny valley, with dead eyes and goofy tusks which better art designers would have reworked. the film's cities, forests, mountains and tribal encampments look similarly generic and/or cartoonish. and like most high-fantasy films, the fact that we're positioned to root for feudalistic monarchs and thuggish warlords isn't questioned; in the grand scheme of things, gul'dan's no more a jerk than the film's supposed heroes. \"warcraft\" ends with several of its major characters perishing, a bit of audience-contempt designed to set up future sequels. it was financed by legendary pictures, one of the first production companies exclusively set up by hedge fund managers, private equity firms, banksters and big chinese conglomerates; the far east being the modern blockbuster's new el dorado. \"warcraft\" was based on a series of real-time strategy games by blizzard entertainment, in which players harvest wood and minerals and slowly build little forest enclaves. a better film would have devoted its running time to such bucolic resource gathering and simple community building. compared to duncan's vision, 120 minutes of orc manual labour sounds like bliss. work! work! 3/10 \u0096 needs more woodcraft. worth no viewings.", "class": "NEGATIVE"}, {"text": "a film that should've helped

make the wow geeks happy too, so there are realms, clans, portals, kings, wizards, betrays, and if you've never played the game it's all very confusing and more than somewhat boring. the story is complicated, but to sum it up, an evil wizard has destroyed the orcs home world, so he has opened a portal to the realm of the humans, where the orcs think they'll have an easy time taking over, but didn't expect the humans to have a magic guardian. it's a film of fighting, gibberish, and non-sense that i'm sure the gamers loved, but i didn't, i fell asleep. as for the cast, well, i guess the filmmakers spent all their money on the effects and costumes, cause there is really no one of name in this film, and some of these people honestly wouldn't have been cast in their high school plays.

based on video games tend to not be so good, warcraft might be an exception. nevertheless it seems to have gotten a lot of bad press. i noticed that most of the critics who gave the film negative reviews were people who have never played, or were were not familiar with the games. i've been a long-time fan of the warcraft series since the second game came out in 1996. since then i've played through all of the warcraft rts games, and was a world of warcraft subscriber for several years. i was one of the few wow players to earn the achievement \"lore master\" for completing all of the quests in the primary zones vanilla wow (and the first few expansions). so i'm pretty well versed on the story. i did get kind of burned out on world of warcraft after wrath of the lich king. i canceled my subscription soon after reaching the level cap. i would resubscribe for brief periods here and there just to see what's going on, but for the most part i was done with wow. still, i'm a fan of the game and lore, so i guess i'm probably the target demographic for this film. the film was pretty faithful to the lore of the games (and the lore of the games has, itself changed over time since the original warcraft ms-dos that came out in 1994). the film is basically about the first war from that first game warcraft: orcs and humans, focusing on the characters from the first game: garona, lothar (probably the main characters), medhiv, king llane, and blackhand. now if they limited themselves to focusing on just these characters and limited themselves to sticking to just the story of the first game, the film, while being pretty simple, would have probably worked better for those new to the story of warcraft. there would have been fewer characters. fewer simultaneous plots, and they would have been able to focus on developing the stories and characters and easing people into the fantasy via more relatable protagonists. but there's one major problem with doing it this way. the story of the first game was very human-centric. the pov of the orcs was told entirely from the half-orc, garona in the instruction booklet that came with the first game, and it didn't portray the orcs in a very good light at all. on the contrary, it portrayed the orcs as evil warlike savages with almost no redeeming qualities. you actually don't get a deeper understanding of the orcs until warcraft 2 when we are introduced gul'dan, ogrim doomhammer and kil'jaeden. and it's not until warcraft 3 that we actually start to view the orcs in a more sympathetic light with the introduction of the orcs gromm hellscream and, of course, the warchief thrall, son of durotan, a character who was not introduced until world of warcraft (and plays a major role in the most recent expansion). in the film, durotan is, in fact, one of the main protagonists. so, to make a long story short, the problem with this film is exactly that, they're trying to make a long, complicated and lore rich story with a lot of characters, into a short two hour film. perhaps if it was split into two films, one that told the story from the humans pov, and another that told the story from the orcs pov it would have worked better, after all that's how the story was told in the original game. it split the story up into two separate narratives. and, in the end, isn't that always what war comes down to? two opposing narratives competing for dominance. this movie tries to to be sympathetic to both sides of the conflict at the same time. and as result the audience can't get as invested in any of the characters or the conflicts they are engaged in. it loses the sense of urgency and drama. when you try to please everyone, you please no one. well ... that's not true. the film did please me. i enjoyed seeing the lore i've grown up with over the passed 20 years come to life on the screen. i did enjoy the spectacle and the special effects as well. it was a cool movie all things considered.

what the story will be about. i went to the cinema to see the movie today and and here is my take without hopefully any spoilers. first of all, the movie is beautifully done. the animation is great! the music, well, is fine, kind of what you'd expect from warcraft, nothing touchy. there is a fair bit of magic in this movie. i wish there was more magic in lotr, this movie is packed with action and a fair deal of magic. all great points here! the plot, however, as expected from a movie based on a game, and it comes true, sadly. the plot is not profound and very weak. i am not going to reveal any of that here. acting and cast. it's a mixed one here, but overall the acting is weak, or rather off. it's all in the human side. the acting gives a very millennial feel, not a historical one. the actor playing the king looks well but his voice is weak and his composure is not regal and majestic enough. in short, lots of action, plenty of magic. if you are into profound plots, you might be disappointed as there is a lot of stuff left unexplained. the acting might get to ya as well. not necessarily by wrong casting, or actors' inabilities, but rather the director's poor choice of how he wanted them to act. go and see the movie, not a waste of money, but this movie will not dwell on your mind too long.", "class": "POSITIVE"}]
